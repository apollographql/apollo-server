  # We make CI fail if any file contains FIX and ME right next to each other.
  # This means that when working on a big PR, you can throw in notes that you
  # are forced to come back to before merging the PR.  Note that we don't block
  # the tarball or publish steps on this, since you may want to try out builds
  # on branches that still contain unresolved problems. In order for this file
  # to not cause this job to fail, we obfuscate the target string by encoding
  # the last letter in in hex (\x45 = E).
