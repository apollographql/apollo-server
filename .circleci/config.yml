# These are the steps used for each version of Node which we're testing
# against.  Thanks to YAMLs inability to merge arrays (though it is able
# to merge objects), every version of Node must use the exact same steps,
# or these steps would need to be repeated in a version of Node that needs
# something different.  Probably best to avoid that, out of principle, though.
