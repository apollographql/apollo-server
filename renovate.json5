  // It seems like a nice idea to let Renovate use GitHub's native "automerge" since PRs
  // can get merged between Renovate runs. The downsides are:
  // - Renovate doesn't seem to set up the automerges to use squash-and-merge (this is
  //   likely going to be fixed, see eg https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/12290)
  // - When Renovate does the merge itself, it does its best to ensure that the PR is fully
  //   rebased on main so that the CI that ran is based on main rather than a possibly slightly
  //   old branch point. GH auto-merge doesn't have that property so it's a bit more likely that
  //   a deps update could break the build if there are recent related changes.
