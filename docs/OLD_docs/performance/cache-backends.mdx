title: Configuring cache backends
description: How to configure Apollo Server's cache
---

> ⚠️ **New in Apollo Server 3.9:** We _strongly recommend_ that all users pass `cache: "bounded"` or configure their cache in a manner that isn't unbounded (which is current default behavior). This protects your server from attacks that exhaust available memory, causing a DOS. See [Ensuring a bounded cache](#ensuring-a-bounded-cache) immediately below for more details.

Many Apollo Server features take advantage of a cache backend (these features include [automatic persisted queries](./apq), the [response cache plugin](./caching#caching-with-responsecacheplugin-advanced), and [`RESTDataSource`](../data/data-sources#restdatasource-reference)). Apollo Server uses an in-memory cache by default, but you can configure it to use a different backend, such as Redis or Memcached.

You can specify a cache backend by passing a `cache` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor. Your specified cache backend must implement the [`KeyValueCache`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/tree/main/packages/keyValueCache#keyvaluecache-interface) interface from the `@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache` package.

There are many cache backend implementations to choose from, including several implementations provided by Apollo. For example, Apollo maintains an implementation of `InMemoryLRUCache` in the `@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache` package. Apollo also provides a wrapper class for the  [`keyv` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv) (which implements several cache backends) named [`KeyvAdapter`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/tree/main/packages/keyvAdapter#keyvadapter-class) in the `@apollo/utils.keyvadapter` package.

## Ensuring a bounded cache

Unfortunately, the default configuration of Apollo Server exposes you to denial of service attacks.
This is because APQs are enabled by default and the default cache in Apollo Server 3 is unbounded, meaning an attacker can exhaust your memory and crash your server. The default cache in Apollo Server 4 will be bounded; **we recommend opting in to that behavior by providing the `cache: "bounded"` option to your Apollo Server constructor or configuring the `cache` yourself.** Alternatively, you can disable APQs by passing `persistedQueries: false` or configure the APQ cache separately by passing a `KeyValueCache` to `persistedQueries: { cache }`.

## Configuring in-memory caching

**Apollo Server's default caching features use an unbounded cache, which is not safe for production use.** If you want to configure the in-memory cache, Apollo provides the [`InMemoryLRUCache`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/tree/main/packages/keyValueCache#inmemorylrucache) class from the `@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache` package.

The `InMemoryLRUCache` class is a wrapper around the `lru-cache` package and has a default maximum of approximately 30MiB of memory. You can configure an instance of `InMemoryLRUCache` with the same options as found in the `lru-cache` package, see the [`lru-cache` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache) for more details. You can use Apollo's `InMemoryLRUCache` by passing it to the `cache` option of the `ApolloServer` constructor like so:

```ts
import { InMemoryLRUCache } from '@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  cache: new InMemoryLRUCache(),
});
```
> The equivalent of this is provided out-of-the-box by Apollo Server 3.9+ by passing `cache: "bounded"` and doesn't require you to install the `@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache` package.

In this example, we've increased the default size and provided a default TTL. For more information on these configuration options, see the [`lru-cache` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache).
```ts
import { InMemoryLRUCache } from '@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  // ...
  cache: new InMemoryLRUCache({
    // ~100MiB
    maxSize: Math.pow(2, 20) * 100,
    // 5 minutes (in milliseconds)
    ttl: 300_000,
  }),
});
```

## Configuring external caching

Apollo no longer maintains any caching backends directly. Instead, we recommend using the [`keyv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv) package along with the [`KeyvAdapter`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/tree/main/packages/keyvAdapter#keyvadapter-class) class provided by the `@apollo/utils.keyvadapter` package. `KeyvAdapter` simply wraps a `Keyv` instance and implements the `KeyValueCache` interface which is required by Apollo Server. You can use the `KeyvAdapter` class to wrap a `Keyv` instance and provide it to the `cache` option of the `ApolloServer` constructor like so:

1. Install the required packages
```bash
npm install keyv @apollo/utils.keyvadapter
```

2. Configure the Apollo Server `cache`
```ts
import Keyv from 'keyv';
import { KeyvAdapter } from '@apollo/utils.keyvadapter';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  // ...,
  cache: new KeyvAdapter(new Keyv()), // highlight-line
});
```

## Implementing your own cache backend

If your requirements are specialized or you'd prefer to implement your own cache backend, you can implement the `KeyValueCache` interface and pass it to the `ApolloServer` constructor directly.

The `KeyValueCache` interface is shown below:
```ts
interface KeyValueCache<V> {
  get(key: string): Promise<V | undefined>;
  // ttl is specified in seconds
  set(key: string, value: V, options?: { ttl?: number | null }): Promise<void>;
  delete(key: string): Promise<boolean | void>;
}
```

## Configuring Redis

The `@keyv/redis` package uses the `ioredis` package under the hood. The second
options argument is passed through to the `ioredis.Redis` constructor. See the
[`ioredis` docs](https://github.com/luin/ioredis#connect-to-redis) for a list of
available options.

Start by installing the required packages:
```
npm install keyv @keyv/redis @apollo/utils.keyvadapter
```

### Single instance
```ts
import Keyv from "keyv";
import { KeyvAdapter } from "@apollo/utils.keyvadapter";

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  cache: new KeyvAdapter(new Keyv("redis://user:pass@localhost:6379")), // highlight-line
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
  ],
});
```

### Redis Sentinel
```ts
import Keyv from "keyv";
import { KeyvAdapter } from "@apollo/utils.keyvadapter";

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  // highlight-start
  cache: new KeyvAdapter(
    new Keyv("redis://user:pass@localhost:6379", {
      sentinels: [
        { host: "localhost", port: 26379 },
        { host: "localhost", port: 26380 },
      ],
    })
  ),
  // highlight-end
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
  ],
});
```

### Redis Cluster

The `@keyv/redis` package doesn't support `ioredis.Cluster` out of the box.
Instead, we can create our own `ioredis.Cluster` instance and pass that to
`keyv` as the `store` object. See the [`ioredis.Cluster`
docs](https://github.com/luin/ioredis#cluster) for a list of available options.

Start by installing the packages we'll need:
```
npm install keyv @keyv/redis ioredis @apollo/utils.keyvadapter
```

```ts
import Keyv from "keyv";
import KeyvRedis from "@keyv/redis";
import Redis from "ioredis";
import { KeyvAdapter } from "@apollo/utils.keyvadapter";

// highlight-start
const cluster = new Redis.Cluster([
  { host: "localhost", port: 26379 },
  { host: "localhost", port: 26380 },
]);
// highlight-end

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  // highlight-start
  cache: new KeyvAdapter(new Keyv({ store: new KeyvRedis(cluster) }), {
    disableBatchReads: true,
  }),
  // highlight-end
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
  ],
});
```

> Note the `disableBatchReads` option. This disables batching which isn't
supported by `ioredis.Cluster`.

## Configuring Memcache

The `@keyv/memcache` package uses the `memjs` package under the hood. Its second
options argument is passed to `memjs.Client.create()`. See the [`memjs`
docs](https://memjs.netlify.app/#section-3) for a list of available options.

Start by installing the required packages:
```
npm install keyv @keyv/memcache @apollo/utils.keyvadapter
```

```ts
import Keyv from "keyv";
import KeyvMemcache from "@keyv/memcache";
import { KeyvAdapter } from "@apollo/utils.keyvadapter";

// servers is a comma-separated list of strings
// highlight-start
const servers = [
  "user:pass@localhost:11211",
  "user:pass@localhost:11222"
].join(",");

const memcache = new KeyvMemcache(servers, {
  retries: 10,
  expires: 60,
});
// highlight-end

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  cache: new KeyvAdapter(new Keyv({ store: memcache })), // highlight-line
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
  ],
});
```

## Legacy caching implementation

Versions of Apollo Server prior to 3.9 use the `apollo-server-caching` package to implement caching. The `apollo-server-caching` package is no longer maintained, and we do not recommend using it. The `KeyValueCache` interface has been moved and is now in the `@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache` package.

The `InMemoryLRUCache` class has also moved to the `@apollo/utils.keyvaluecache` package. The `InMemoryLRUCache` class now uses version 7 of `lru-cache`, accepting different configuration options and no longer allowing a cache to be unbounded.

The `apollo-server-cache-redis` and `apollo-server-cache-memcached` packages are no longer receiving updates; we recommend using `keyv` instead, as shown above.
