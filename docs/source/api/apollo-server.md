This API reference documents the exports from the `apollo-server` package.

## `class ApolloServer`

The core of an Apollo Server implementation. For an example, see [Get started with Apollo Server](/getting-started/).

### Methods

#### `constructor`

Returns an initialized `ApolloServer` instance.

Takes an `options` object as a parameter. Supported fields of this object are described in [Options](#options).

##### Example

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
	typeDefs,
	resolvers
});
```

##### Options

**Schema options**
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `typeDefs`

`DocumentNode` or `Array<DocumentNode>`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** Document or documents that represent your server's GraphQL schema, generated by applying the [`gql`](#gql) tag to valid Schema Definition Language (SDL) strings.

For an example, see [Define your GraphQL schema](../getting-started/#step-3-define-your-graphql-schema).
</td>
</tr>


<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `resolvers`

`Object` or `Array`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** A map of functions that populate data for individual schema fields. Can also be an array of multiple maps that are merged.

For details, see [Resolvers](../data/resolvers/).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `context`

`Object` or `Function`
</td>
<td>

An object (or a function that _creates_ an object) that's passed to every resolver that executes for a particular operation. This enables resolvers to share helpful context, such as a database connection.

[Certain fields](#middleware-specific-context-fields) are added to this object automatically, depending on which [Node.js middleware](../integrations/middleware/) your server uses.

For more details, see [The `context` argument](../data/resolvers/#the-context-argument).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `introspection`

`Boolean`
</td>

<td>

If `true`, enables [schema introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) by clients.

The default value is `true`, **unless** the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `schemaDirectives`

`Object`
</td>

<td>

A map of all [custom schema directives](../schema/directives/#using-custom-schema-directives) used in your schema, if any.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `schema`

`Object`
</td>

<td>

An executable GraphQL schema. You usually don't need to provide this value, because Apollo Server generates it from the `typeDefs` and `resolvers` you provide.

This field is most commonly used with [Apollo Federation](/federation/implementing-services/#generating-a-federated-schema), which uses a special `buildFederatedSchema` function to generate its schema.

Note that if you are using [file uploads](../data/file-uploads/), you need to add the `Upload` scalar to your schema manually before providing it here.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `persistedQueries`

`Object` or `false`
</td>

<td>

If you're using [automated persisted queries (APQ)](../performance/apq/), you can provide an object with a `cache` field as the value of this option to customize where Apolllo Server stores the mapping between operation hashes and query strings.

Provide `false` to disable APQ entirely.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `subscriptions`

`Object` or `String` or `false`
</td>

<td>

Provide a `String` to specify the server's subscription-specific endpoint, or an `Object` to further [configure subscription behavior](#subscription-configuration-fields).

Provide `false` to disable subscription operations entirely.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `rootValue`

`Any` or `Function`
</td>
<td>

A value or function called with the parsed `Document`, creating the root value passed to the GraphQL executor.

Providing a function is useful if you want to use a different root value depending on the operation's details, such as whether it's a query or mutation.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `validationRules`

`Object`
</td>
<td>

An object containing custom functions to use as additional [validation rules](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/validation/rules) when validating the schema.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">

**Networking options**
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `cors`

`Object` or `Boolean`
</td>
<td>

An `Object` containing [configuration options](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) for the server's CORS behavior. Provide `false` to remove CORS middleware entirely.

This option is used only by the `apollo-server` package. If you're integrating with Node.js middleware via a different package, instead see [`applyMiddleware`](#applymiddleware).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `cacheControl`

`Object`
</td>
<td>

An `Object` containing [configuration options for the `apollo-cache-control` package](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-cache-control/src/index.ts#L26-L32), including `defaultMaxAge`, `calculateHttpHeaders`, and `stripFormattedExtensions`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `formatError`

`Function`
</td>
<td>

Provide this function to transform the structure of error objects before they're sent to a client. The function takes a [`GraphQLError`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/error/GraphQLError.js) object and should return a [`GraphQLFormattedError`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/error/formatError.js#L26) object.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `formatResponse`

`Function`
</td>
<td>

Provide this function to transform the structure of GraphQL response objects before they're sent to a client. The function takes a [`GraphQLResponse`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L77-L82) object and a [`GraphQLRequestContext`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L95-L130) object, and it should return a `GraphQLResponse` object.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `apollo`

`ApolloConfigInput`
<td>

An object containing configuration options for connecting Apollo Server to [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/). Each field of this object can also be set with an environment variable, which is the recommended method of setting these parameters. All fields are optional. The fields are:

- `key`: The [graph API key](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/api-keys/#graph-api-keys) that Apollo Server should use to authenticate with Apollo Studio. You can set this with the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable.
- `graphId`: The ID of your graph in Apollo's registry. You can set this with the `APOLLO_GRAPH_ID` environment variable. Most users will not specify this explicitly and allow Apollo Server to infer the ID from your API key.
- `graphVariant`: The [variant](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema/registry/#managing-environments-with-variants) of your graph to associate this server's schema and metrics with. You can set this with the `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT` environment variable. The default value is `current`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `engine`

`Object` or `Boolean`
</td>
<td>

This deprecated option is how you configured connecting Apollo Server to [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/) before Apollo Server 2.18. New code should configure the Studio connection plugins directly instead. See [the migration docs](../migration-engine-plugins/) for details.

</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td colspan="2">

**Lifecycle options**
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `plugins`

`Array<PluginDefinition>`
</td>
<td>

An array of plugins to install in your server. Each plugin definition is either an object with methods like `requestDidStart` and `serverWillStart`, or zero-argument function returning an object of that form. See [the full plugin documentation](../integrations/plugins/) for more details.

In addition to the plugins you explicitly install, Apollo Server ships with a few plugins that it enables in certain contexts (like when you specify an Apollo API key with `$APOLLO_KEY`, or if the server is a federated implementing service). See the API references for the [usage reporting](./plugin/usage-reporting/), [schema reporting](./plugin/schema-reporting/), and [inline trace](./plugin/inline-trace/) plugins for details.

</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `stopOnTerminationSignals`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

By default (when running in Node and when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable does not equal `test`), ApolloServer listens for the `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals and calls `await this.stop()` on itself when it is received, and then re-sends the signal to itself so that process shutdown can continue. Set this to false to disable this behavior, or to true to enable this behavior even when `NODE_ENV` is `test`. You can manually invoke `stop()` in other contexts if you'd like. Note that `stop()` does not run synchronously so it cannot work usefully in an `process.on('exit')` handler.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">

**Debugging options**
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `playground`

`Boolean` or `Object`
</td>
<td>

If truthy, the server hosts [GraphQL Playground](../testing/graphql-playground) from its URL. Can be an object to pass [configuration options](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground/#usage) to the playground.

The default value is `true`, **unless** the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`.

Note that [`introspection`](#introspection) must be enabled for GraphQL Playground to function properly.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `debug`

`Boolean`
</td>

<td>

If `true`, enables development mode helpers and logs messages of all severity levels (`debug` through `error`). If `false`, only `warn`- and `error`-level messages are logged.

Defaults to `true`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `logger`

[`Logger`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L146-L152)
</td>
<td>

An object to use for logging in place of `console`. If provided, this object must implement all methods of [the `Logger` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L146-L152).

If you provide this value, Apollo Server automatically logs all messages of _all_ severity levels (`debug` through `error`), regardless of whether the `debug` option is set to `true`. It is the responsibility of the logger to determine how to handle logged messages of each level.

This logger is automatically added to the `GraphQLRequestContext` object that's passed to all Apollo Server [plugin functions](../integrations/plugins/).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `mocks`

`Boolean` or `Object`
</td>
<td>

If `true`, enables [default mock resolvers](../testing/mocking/#default-mock-example) for schema fields. If an object, enables [_custom_ mock resolvers](../testing/mocking/#customizing-mocks) based on the object's fields.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `mockEntireSchema`

`Boolean`
</td>
<td>

If `true` and `mocks` is also specified, mock resolvers are enabled even for fields that you've defined a resolver for.

The default value is `true`. Set this to `false` to use mocked resolvers only for fields that you _haven't_ defined a resolver for.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

##### Experimental options

**These options are experimental.**  They might be removed or change at any time, even within a patch release.

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
<td>

###### `experimental_approximateDocumentStoreMiB`

`number`
</td>
<td>

Sets the approximate size (in MiB) of the server's `DocumentNode` cache. The server checks the SHA-256 hash of each incoming operation against cached `DocumentNode`s, and skips unnecessary parsing and validation if a match is found.

The cache's default size is 30MiB, which is usually sufficient unless the server processes a large number of unique operations.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

##### Middleware-specific `context` fields

The `context` object passed between Apollo Server resolvers automatically includes certain fields, depending on which [Node.js middleware](../integrations/middleware/) you're using:

`String`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** The URL for the server's subscription-specific endpoint.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `keepAlive`

`Number`
</td>
<td>

The frequency with which the subscription endpoint should send keep-alive messages to open client connections, in milliseconds, if any.

If this value isn't provided, the subscription endpoint doesn't send keep-alive messages.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `onConnect`

`Function`
</td>

<td>

A lifecycle hook that's called whenever a subscription connection is initiated by a client. [See an example](../data/subscriptions/#authentication-over-websocket)
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `onDisconnect`

`Function`
</td>

<td>

A lifecycle hook that's called whenever a subscription connection is terminated by a client.
</td>
</tr>


</tbody>
</table>

#### `listen`

Instructs Apollo Server to begin listening for requests.

> This method is provided only by the `apollo-server` package. If you're integrating with Node.js middleware via a different package (such as `apollo-server-express`, instead see [`applyMiddleware`](#applymiddleware).

##### Parameters

* `options`: <`Object`>

  When using the `apollo-server` package, calling `listen` on an instantiated `ApolloServer` will start the server by passing the specified (optional) `options` to a Node.js [`http.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server).  For a full reference of the supported `options`, see the [documentation for `net.Server.listen`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_options_callback).

##### Returns

`Promise` that resolves to an object containing the following properties:

  * `url`: <`String`>
  * `subscriptionsPath`: <`String`>
  * `server`: &lt;[`http.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server)&gt;

#### `applyMiddleware`

The `applyMiddleware` method is provided by the `apollo-server-{integration}` packages that use middleware, such as hapi and express. This method connects `ApolloServer` to a specific HTTP framework.

##### Parameters

* `options`: <`Object`>

  * `app`: <`HttpServer`> _(required)_

    Pass an instance of the server integration here.

  * `path` : <`String`>

    Specify a custom path. It defaults to `/graphql` if no path is specified.

  * `cors`: <`Object` | `boolean`> ([express](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#cors), [hapi](https://hapijs.com/api#-routeoptionscors), [koa](https://github.com/koajs/cors/))

    Pass the integration-specific cors options. False removes the cors middleware and true uses the defaults.

  * `bodyParserConfig`: <`Object` | `boolean`> ([express](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#body-parser), [koa](https://github.com/koajs/bodyparser))

    Pass the body-parser options. False removes the body parser middleware and true uses the defaults.

##### Usage

The `applyMiddleware` method from `apollo-server-express` registration of middleware as shown in the example below:

```js
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  // These will be defined for both new or existing servers
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const app = express();
// Additional middleware can be mounted at this point to run before Apollo.
app.use('*', jwtCheck, requireAuth, checkScope);

server.applyMiddleware({ app, path: '/specialUrl' }); // app is from an existing express app. Mount Apollo middleware here. If no path is specified, it defaults to `/graphql`.
```

#### `getMiddleware`

Similar to the `applyMiddleware` method above, though rather than applying the composition of the various Apollo Server middlewares which comprise a full-featured Apollo Server deployment (e.g. middleware for HTTP body parsing, GraphQL Playground, uploads and subscriptions) the `getMiddleware` simply returns the middleware.

The `getMiddleware` method takes the same arguments as `applyMiddleware` **except** `app` should not be passed.  Instead, the result of `getMiddleware` must be added as a middleware directly to an existing application (e.g. with `app.use(...)`).

For example, for `apollo-server-express`, this means that rather than passing `applyMiddleware` an `app` which was already initiated from calling `express()`, and `applyMiddleware` "using" (i.e. `app.use`), the implementor will instead call `app.use(...)` on the result of `getMiddleware` with the same arguments.

## `gql`

The `gql` is a [template literal tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). Template literals were introduced in recent versions of ECMAScript to provide embedded expressions (i.e. `` `A string with interpolated ${variables}` ``) and template literal tags exist to provide additional functionality for what would otherwise be a normal template literal.

In the case of GraphQL, the `gql` tag is used to surround GraphQL operation and schema language (which are represented as `String`s), and makes it easier to differentiate from ordinary strings. This is particularly useful when performing static analysis on GraphQL language (e.g. to enable syntax highlighting, code generation, etc.) and avoids need for tools to "guess" if a string contains GraphQL language.

### Usage

Import the `gql` template literal tag into the current context from the `apollo-server` or `apollo-server-{integration}` modules:

```js
const { gql } = require('apollo-server');
```

Then, place GraphQL schema definitions (SDL), queries or other operations into the `gql` template literal tag. Keep in mind that template literals use the grave accent (`` ` ``) and not normal quotation marks (e.g. not `"` or `'`):

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Author {
    name
  }
`;
```

## `makeExecutableSchema`

The `makeExecutableSchema` method is re-exported from apollo-server as a convenience.

### Parameters

* `options` : <`Object`>
  * `typeDefs`: <`GraphQLSchema`> _(required)_
  * `resolvers` : <`Object`> : <`Array<Object>`>
  * `logger` : <`Object`>
  * `allowUndefinedInResolve` = false
  * `resolverValidationOptions` = {}
  * `directiveResolvers` = null
  * `schemaDirectives` = null
  * `parseOptions` = {}
  * `inheritResolversFromInterfaces` = false

## `addMockFunctionsToSchema`

The `addMockFunctionsToSchema` method is re-exported from `apollo-server` as a convenience.

Given an instance of a `GraphQLSchema` and a `mock` object, modifies the schema (in place) to return mock data for any valid query that is sent to the server.

If preserveResolvers is set to true, existing resolve functions will not be overwritten to provide mock data. This can be used to mock some parts of the server and not others.

### Parameters

* `options`: <`Object`>

  * `schema`: <`GraphQLSchema`> _(required)_

    Pass an executable schema (`GraphQLSchema`) to be mocked.

  * `mocks`: <`Object`>

    Should be a map of types to mock resolver functions, e.g.:

    ```js
    {
      Type: () => true,
    }
    ```

    When `mocks` is not defined, the default scalar types (e.g. `Int`, `Float`, `String`, etc.) will be mocked.

  * `preserveResolvers`: <`Boolean`>

    When `true`, resolvers which were already defined will not be over-written with the mock resolver functions specified with `mocks`.

### Usage

```js
const { addMockFunctionsToSchema } = require('apollo-server');

// We'll make an assumption that an executable schema
// is already available from the `./schema` file.
const executableSchema = require('./schema');

addMockFunctionsToSchema({
  schema: executableSchema,
  mocks: {
    // Mocks the `Int` scalar type to always return `12345`.
    Int: () => 12345,

    // Mocks the `Movies` type to always return 'Titanic'.
    Movies: () => 'Titanic',
  },
  preserveResolvers: false,
});
```
