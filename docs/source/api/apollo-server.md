This API reference documents the exports from the `apollo-server` package.

## `class ApolloServer`

The core of an Apollo Server implementation. For an example, see [Get started with Apollo Server](/getting-started/).

### Methods

#### `constructor`

Returns an initialized `ApolloServer` instance.

Takes an `options` object as a parameter. Supported fields of this object are described in [Options](#options).

##### Example

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
	typeDefs,
	resolvers
});
```

##### Options

**Schema options**
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `typeDefs`
</td>
<td>

`DocumentNode` or `Array<DocumentNode>`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** Document or documents that represent your server's GraphQL schema, generated by applying the [`gql`](#gql) tag to valid Schema Definition Language (SDL) strings.

For an example, see [Define your GraphQL schema](../getting-started/#step-3-define-your-graphql-schema).
</td>
</tr>


<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `resolvers`
</td>
<td>

`Object` or `Array`
<td>

**Required.** A map of functions that populate data for individual schema fields. Can also be an array of multiple maps that are merged.

For details, see [Resolvers](../data/resolvers/).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `context`
</td>
<td>

`Object` or `Function`
<td>

An object (or a function that _creates_ an object) that's passed to every resolver that executes for a particular operation. This enables resolvers to share helpful context, such as a database connection.

[Certain fields](#middleware-specific-context-fields) are added to this object automatically, depending on which [Node.js middleware](../integrations/middleware/) your server uses.

For more details, see [The `context` argument](../data/resolvers/#the-context-argument).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `introspection`
</td>
<td>

`Boolean`
<td>

If `true`, enables [schema introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) by clients.

The default value is `true`, **unless** the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `schemaDirectives`
</td>
<td>

`Object`
<td>

A map of all [custom schema directives](../schema/directives/#using-custom-schema-directives) used in your schema, if any.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `schema`
</td>
<td>

`Object`
<td>

An executable GraphQL schema. You usually don't need to provide this value, because Apollo Server generates it from the `typeDefs` and `resolvers` you provide.

This field is most commonly used with [Apollo Federation](/federation/implementing-services/#generating-a-federated-schema), which uses a special `buildFederatedSchema` function to generate its schema.

Note that if you are using [file uploads](../data/file-uploads/), you need to add the `Upload` scalar to your schema manually before providing it here.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `persistedQueries`
</td>
<td>

`Object` or `false`
<td>

If you're using [automated persisted queries (APQ)](../performance/apq/), you can provide an object with a `cache` field as the value of this option to customize where Apolllo Server stores the mapping between operation hashes and query strings.

Provide `false` to disable APQ entirely.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `subscriptions`
</td>
<td>

`Object` or `String` or `false`
<td>

Provide a `String` to specify the server's subscription-specific endpoint, or an `Object` to further [configure subscription behavior](#subscription-configuration-fields).

Provide `false` to disable subscription operations entirely.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `rootValue`
</td>
<td>

`Any` or `Function`
<td>

A value or function called with the parsed `Document`, creating the root value passed to the GraphQL executor.

Providing a function is useful if you want to use a different root value depending on the operation's details, such as whether it's a query or mutation.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `validationRules`
</td>
<td>

`Object`
<td>

An object containing custom functions to use as additional [validation rules](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/validation/rules) when validating the schema.
</td>
</tr>

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `engine`
</td>
<td>

`EngineReportingOptions`
<td>

An object containing configuration options for connecting Apollo Server to [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/).

Supported fields are described in [EngineReportingOptions](#enginereportingoptions).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `cors`
</td>
<td>

`Object` or `Boolean`
<td>

An `Object` containing [configuration options](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) for the server's CORS behavior. Provide `false` to remove CORS middleware entirely.

This option is used only by the `apollo-server` package. If you're integrating with Node.js middleware via a different package, instead see [`applyMiddleware`](#applymiddleware).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `formatError`
</td>
<td>

`Function`
<td>

Provide this function to transform the structure of error objects before they're sent to a client. The function takes a [`GraphQLError`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/error/GraphQLError.js) object and should return a [`GraphQLFormattedError`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/error/formatError.js#L26) object.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `formatResponse`
</td>
<td>

`Function`
<td>

Provide this function to transform the structure of GraphQL response objects before they're sent to a client. The function takes a [`GraphQLResponse`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L77-L82) object and a [`GraphQLRequestContext`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L95-L130) object, and it should return a `GraphQLResponse` object.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="3">

**Debugging options**
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `playground`
</td>
<td>

`Boolean` or `Object`
<td>

If truthy, the server hosts [GraphQL Playground](../testing/graphql-playground) from its URL. Can be an object to pass [configuration options](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground/#usage) to the playground.

The default value is `true`, **unless** the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`.

Note that [`introspection`](#introspection) must be enabled for GraphQL Playground to function properly.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `debug`
</td>
<td>

`Boolean`
<td>

If `true`, enables development mode helpers and logs messages of all severity levels (`debug` through `error`). If `false`, only `warn`- and `error`-level messages are logged.

Defaults to `true`.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `logger`
</td>
<td>

[`Logger`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L146-L152)
<td>

An object to use for logging in place of `console`. If provided, this object must implement all methods of [the `Logger` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L146-L152).

If you provide this value, Apollo Server automatically logs all messages of _all_ severity levels (`debug` through `error`), regardless of whether the `debug` option is set to `true`. It is the responsibility of the logger to determine how to handle logged messages of each level.

This logger is automatically added to the `GraphQLRequestContext` object that's passed to all Apollo Server [plugin functions](../integrations/plugins/).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `mocks`
</td>
<td>

`Boolean` or `Object`
<td>

If `true`, enables [default mock resolvers](../testing/mocking/#default-mock-example) for schema fields. If an object, enables [_custom_ mock resolvers](../testing/mocking/#customizing-mocks) based on the object's fields.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

###### `mockEntireSchema`
</td>
<td>

`Boolean`
<td>

If `true` and `mocks` is also specified, mock resolvers are enabled even for fields that you've defined a resolver for.

The default value is `true`. Set this to `false` to use mocked resolvers only for fields that you _haven't_ defined a resolver for.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

*  `experimental_approximateDocumentStoreSizeMiB`
    * `number`
    * **This option is experimental.**  It might be removed or change at any time, even within a patch release.</p><p>Sets the approximate size (in MiB) of the server's `DocumentNode` cache. The server checks the SHA-256 hash of each incoming operation against cached `DocumentNode`s, and skips unnecessary parsing and validation if a match is found.</p><p>The cache's default size is 30MiB, which is usually sufficient unless the server processes a large number of unique operations.</p>

##### Middleware-specific `context` fields

The `context` object passed between Apollo Server resolvers automatically includes certain fields, depending on which [Node.js middleware](../integrations/middleware/) you're using:

</tbody>
</table>

#### `listen`

Instructs Apollo Server to begin listening for requests.

> This method is provided only by the `apollo-server` package. If you're integrating with Node.js middleware via a different package (such as `apollo-server-express`, instead see [`applyMiddleware`](#applymiddleware).

##### Parameters

* `options`: <`Object`>

  When using the `apollo-server` package, calling `listen` on an instantiated `ApolloServer` will start the server by passing the specified (optional) `options` to a Node.js [`http.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server).  For a full reference of the supported `options`, see the [documentation for `net.Server.listen`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_options_callback).

##### Returns

`Promise` that resolves to an object containing the following properties:

  * `url`: <`String`>
  * `subscriptionsPath`: <`String`>
  * `server`: &lt;[`http.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server)&gt;

#### `applyMiddleware`

The `applyMiddleware` method is provided by the `apollo-server-{integration}` packages that use middleware, such as hapi and express. This method connects `ApolloServer` to a specific HTTP framework.

##### Parameters

* `options`: <`Object`>

  * `app`: <`HttpServer`> _(required)_

    Pass an instance of the server integration here.

  * `path` : <`String`>

    Specify a custom path. It defaults to `/graphql` if no path is specified.

  * `cors`: <`Object` | `boolean`> ([express](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#cors), [hapi](https://hapijs.com/api#-routeoptionscors), [koa](https://github.com/koajs/cors/))

    Pass the integration-specific cors options. False removes the cors middleware and true uses the defaults.

  * `bodyParserConfig`: <`Object` | `boolean`> ([express](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#body-parser), [koa](https://github.com/koajs/bodyparser))

    Pass the body-parser options. False removes the body parser middleware and true uses the defaults.

##### Usage

The `applyMiddleware` method from `apollo-server-express` registration of middleware as shown in the example below:

```js
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  // These will be defined for both new or existing servers
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const app = express();
// Additional middleware can be mounted at this point to run before Apollo.
app.use('*', jwtCheck, requireAuth, checkScope);

server.applyMiddleware({ app, path: '/specialUrl' }); // app is from an existing express app. Mount Apollo middleware here. If no path is specified, it defaults to `/graphql`.
```

#### `getMiddleware`

Similar to the `applyMiddleware` method above, though rather than applying the composition of the various Apollo Server middlewares which comprise a full-featured Apollo Server deployment (e.g. middleware for HTTP body parsing, GraphQL Playground, uploads and subscriptions) the `getMiddleware` simply returns the middleware.

The `getMiddleware` method takes the same arguments as `applyMiddleware` **except** `app` should not be passed.  Instead, the result of `getMiddleware` must be added as a middleware directly to an existing application (e.g. with `app.use(...)`).

For example, for `apollo-server-express`, this means that rather than passing `applyMiddleware` an `app` which was already initiated from calling `express()`, and `applyMiddleware` "using" (i.e. `app.use`), the implementor will instead call `app.use(...)` on the result of `getMiddleware` with the same arguments.

## `gql`

The `gql` is a [template literal tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates). Template literals were introduced in recent versions of ECMAScript to provide embedded expressions (i.e. `` `A string with interpolated ${variables}` ``) and template literal tags exist to provide additional functionality for what would otherwise be a normal template literal.

In the case of GraphQL, the `gql` tag is used to surround GraphQL operation and schema language (which are represented as `String`s), and makes it easier to differentiate from ordinary strings. This is particularly useful when performing static analysis on GraphQL language (e.g. to enable syntax highlighting, code generation, etc.) and avoids need for tools to "guess" if a string contains GraphQL language.

### Usage

Import the `gql` template literal tag into the current context from the `apollo-server` or `apollo-server-{integration}` modules:

```js
const { gql } = require('apollo-server');
```

Then, place GraphQL schema definitions (SDL), queries or other operations into the `gql` template literal tag. Keep in mind that template literals use the grave accent (`` ` ``) and not normal quotation marks (e.g. not `"` or `'`):

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Author {
    name
  }
`;
```

## `makeExecutableSchema`

The `makeExecutableSchema` method is re-exported from apollo-server as a convenience.

### Parameters

* `options` : <`Object`>
  * `typeDefs`: <`GraphQLSchema`> _(required)_
  * `resolvers` : <`Object`> : <`Array<Object>`>
  * `logger` : <`Object`>
  * `allowUndefinedInResolve` = false
  * `resolverValidationOptions` = {}
  * `directiveResolvers` = null
  * `schemaDirectives` = null
  * `parseOptions` = {}
  * `inheritResolversFromInterfaces` = false

## `addMockFunctionsToSchema`

The `addMockFunctionsToSchema` method is re-exported from `apollo-server` as a convenience.

Given an instance of a `GraphQLSchema` and a `mock` object, modifies the schema (in place) to return mock data for any valid query that is sent to the server.

If preserveResolvers is set to true, existing resolve functions will not be overwritten to provide mock data. This can be used to mock some parts of the server and not others.

### Parameters

* `options`: <`Object`>

  * `schema`: <`GraphQLSchema`> _(required)_

    Pass an executable schema (`GraphQLSchema`) to be mocked.

  * `mocks`: <`Object`>

    Should be a map of types to mock resolver functions, e.g.:

    ```js
    {
      Type: () => true,
    }
    ```

    When `mocks` is not defined, the default scalar types (e.g. `Int`, `Float`, `String`, etc.) will be mocked.

  * `preserveResolvers`: <`Boolean`>

    When `true`, resolvers which were already defined will not be over-written with the mock resolver functions specified with `mocks`.

### Usage

```js
const { addMockFunctionsToSchema } = require('apollo-server');

// We'll make an assumption that an executable schema
// is already available from the `./schema` file.
const executableSchema = require('./schema');

addMockFunctionsToSchema({
  schema: executableSchema,
  mocks: {
    // Mocks the `Int` scalar type to always return `12345`.
    Int: () => 12345,

    // Mocks the `Movies` type to always return 'Titanic'.
    Movies: () => 'Titanic',
  },
  preserveResolvers: false,
});
```

## `EngineReportingOptions`

These are the supported fields of the `engine` object you provide to the [`ApolloServer` constructor](#constructor) to configure communication with [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/).

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Base config** |
| `apiKey` | `String` | <p>The [graph API key](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/api-keys/#graph-api-keys) that Apollo Server should use to authenticate with Apollo Studio.</p><p>Instead of using this field, we recommend providing your API key by setting it as the value of the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable in your server's environment.</p>  |
| `graphVariant` | `String` | <p>The [variant](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema/registry/#managing-environments-with-variants) of your graph to associate this server's schema and metrics with.</p><p>Instead of using this field, we recommend specifying a variant by setting its name as the value of the `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT` environment variable in your server's environment.</p> |
| `logger` | [`Logger`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L146-L152) | <p>If you provide this object, Apollo Server sends it all log messages related to Apollo Studio communication, instead of sending them to the default logger. The object must implement all methods of [the `Logger` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L146-L152).</p> |
| **Schema reporting** |
| `reportSchema` | `Boolean` | <p>If `true`, Apollo Server begins periodically [reporting its schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema/schema-reporting/) to Apollo Studio shortly after startup.</p><p>The default value is `false`.</p> |
| `schemaReportingInitialDelayMaxMs` | `Number` | <p>On startup, Apollo Server waits a random amount of time between 0 milliseconds and this value before it begins reporting its schema. This randomness is useful for staggering schema reports when you deploy multiple server instances simultaneously.</p><p>The default value is 10 seconds (`10000`). You might want to reduce this value in constrained environments, such as AWS Lambda.</p> |
| `overrideReportedSchema` | `String` | <p>By default, Apollo Server **normalizes** its schema before reporting it to Apollo Studio. Doing so helps make sure that no-op changes to a schema's whitespace or field order aren't incorrectly identified as an updated schema.</p><p>If normalization removes details that you want to preserve, you can provide an SDL string directly to this option. If you do, it is reported directly to Studio instead of the server's normalized schema.</p>   |
| **Metrics reporting** |
| `reportIntervalMs` | `Number` | <p>The interval at which Apollo Server should send batched trace reports to Studio, in milliseconds.</p><p>Regardless of this value, Apollo Server sends a trace report whenever the size of a pending batch exceeds the value of `maxUncompressedReportSize` (default 4MB).</p> |
| `maxUncompressedReportSize` | `Number` | <p>Apollo Server sends a trace report whenever the size of a pending batched trace report exceeds this value (in bytes), regardless of its standard reporting interval.</p><p>The default value is 4MB (`4194304`).</p> |
| `maxAttempts` | `Number` | <p>The maximum number of times Apollo Server should attempt to report each trace report, performing exponential backoff between attempts.</p><p>The default value is `5`.</p>  |
| `minimumRetryDelayMs` | `Number` | <p>The minimum amount of backoff (in milliseconds) Apollo Server should perform before retrying a failed trace report.</p><p>The default value is `100`. |
| `reportTiming` | `async Function` or `Boolean` | <p>Provide this async function to determine whether to report metrics to Apollo Studio on an operation-by-operation basis.</p><p>This function is called once per operation. It is passed either a `GraphQLRequestContextDidResolveOperation` object (on operation success) or a `GraphQLRequestContextDiDEncounterErrors` object (if errors occurred). It should return a Promise that resolves to a boolean (metrics are not reported if `false`).</p><p>By default, Apollo Server reports metrics for all operations if reporting is enabled.</p> |
| `sendHeaders` | `Object` | <p>Provide this object to configure which request header names and values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are described in [Valid `sendHeaders` object signatures](#valid-sendheaders-object-signatures).</p><p>The default value is `{ none: true }`, which means **no** header names or values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from potentially reaching Apollo servers.</p>|
| `sendVariableValues` | `Object` | <p>Provide this object to configure which GraphQL variable values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are described in [Valid `sendVariableValues` object signatures](#valid-sendvariablevalues-object-signatures).</p><p>The default value is `{ none: true }`, which means **no** variable values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from potentially reaching Apollo servers.</p>
| `debugPrintReports` | `Boolean` | <p>If `true`, Apollo Server logs a message whenever a trace report is sent or a reporting error occurs.</p><p>The default value is `false`.</p>  |
| `reportErrorFunction` | `Function` | <p>If you provide this function, Apollo Server calls it whenever it encounters an error while reporting metrics. The details of the error are passed to the function.</p><p>By default, Apollo Server logs these errors to stderr.</p> |
| `rewriteError` | `Function` | <p>Specify this function to modify GraphQL operation errors before Apollo Server reports those errors to Apollo Studio. The function takes a [`GraphQLError`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/error/GraphQLError.js) object and must also return one (or `null` to prevent Apollo Server from reporting a particular error entirely).</p><p>The only properties of the reported error you can modify are its `message` and its `extensions`.</p> |
| `requestAgent` | `http.Agent` or `https.Agent` or `false` | An HTTP(S) agent to use for metrics reporting. Can be either an [`http.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) or an [`https.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/https.html#https_class_https_agent). It behaves the same as the `agent` parameter to [`http.request`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback). |
| `generateClientInfo` | `Function` | <p>Specify this function to provide Apollo Studio with client details for each processed operation. Apollo Studio uses this information to [segment metrics by client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/client-awareness/).</p><p>The function is passed a [`GraphQLRequestContext`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L95-L130) object containing all available information about the request. It should return a [`ClientInfo`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-engine-reporting/src/agent.ts#L35-L39) object describing the associated GraphQL client.</p><p>By default, Apollo Server attempts to obtain `ClientInfo` fields from the `clientInfo` field of the GraphQL operation's `extensions`.</p><p>For advanced use cases when you already use an opaque string to identify your client (such as an API key, x509 certificate, or team codename), use the `clientReferenceId` field to add a reference to that internal identity. The reference ID is not displayed in Studio, but it is available for cross-correspondence, so names and reference IDs should have a one-to-one relationship.</p><p>**Warning:** If you specify a `clientReferenceId`, Graph Manager will treat the `clientName` as a secondary lookup, so changing a `clientName` may result in an unwanted experience.</p>|
| `calculateSignature` | `Function` | <p>A custom function to use to calculate the "signature" of the schema that operations are running against. This enables Apollo Studio to detect when two non-identical schema strings represent the exact same underlying model.</p><p>For an example, see the [default signature function](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/blob/master/packages/apollo-graphql/src/operationId.ts), which sorts types and fields, removes extraneous whitespace, and removes unused definitions.</p>  |
| `handleSignals` | `Boolean` | <p>Set to `false` to disable the Apollo Server trace reporting agent's default signal handling behavior.</p><p>By default, the agent listens for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`. Upon receiving either signal, the agent stops, sends a final report, and sends the signal back to itself.</p><p>In addition to disabling the default behavior, you can manually invoke [`stop` and `sendReport`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/packages/apollo-engine-reporting/src/agent.ts) on other signals. Note that `sendReport` is asynchronous, so it should not be called in an `exit` handler.</p> |

##### Valid `sendHeaders` object signatures

You can provide an object with one of the following structures as the value of the `sendHeaders` option in [`EngineReportingOptions`](#enginereportingoptions).

> Regardless of your configuration, Apollo Server **never** sends the values of the following headers to Apollo Studio:
>
> * `authorization`
> * `cookie`
> * `set-cookie`

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `{ none: true }` | If you provide this object, no request header names or values are sent to Apollo Studio. This is the default behavior. |
| `{ all: true }` |  If you provide this object, **all** GraphQL header names and values are sent to Apollo Studio, except for the protected headers listed above. |
| `{ onlyNames: ["apple", "orange"]}`| If you provide an object with this structure, only names and values of the request headers with names that appear in the array are sent to Apollo Studio. Case-insensitive. |
| `{ exceptNames: ["apple", "orange"]}`| If you provide an object with this structure, all GraphQL header values **except** values of headers with names that appear in the array are sent to Apollo Studio. Case-insensitive. |

##### Valid `sendVariableValues` object signatures

You can provide an object with one of the following structures as the value of the `sendVariableValues` option in [`EngineReportingOptions`](#enginereportingoptions).

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `{ none: true }` | If you provide this object, no GraphQL variable values are sent to Apollo Studio. This is the default behavior. |
| `{ all: true }` |  If you provide this object, **all** GraphQL variable values are sent to Apollo Studio. |
| `{ onlyNames: ["apple", "orange"]}`| If you provide an object with this structure, only values of the GraphQL variables with names that appear in the array are sent to Apollo Studio. Case-sensitive. |
| `{ exceptNames: ["apple", "orange"]}`| If you provide an object with this structure, all GraphQL variable values **except** values of variables with names that appear in the array are sent to Apollo Studio. Case-sensitive. |
| `{ transform: ({ variables, operationString)} => { ... } }` | <p>The value of `transform` is a function that takes the values of all GraphQL variables for an operation. The function should modify or delete necessary values in the `variables` map and return the result. You cannot _add_ variables to the map.</p><p>For security reasons, if an error occurs in the `transform` function, **all** variable values are replaced with `[PREDICATE_FUNCTION_ERROR]`. |
