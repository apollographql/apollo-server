<tr>
<td>

##### `context`

`Object` or `Function`
</td>
<td>

An object (or a function that _creates_ an object) that's passed to every resolver that executes for a particular operation. This enables resolvers to share helpful context, such as a database connection.

[Certain fields](#middleware-specific-context-fields) are added to this object automatically, depending on which [Node.js middleware](../integrations/middleware/) your server uses.

For more details, see [The `context` argument](../data/resolvers/#the-context-argument).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

##### `dataSources`

`Function`
</td>
<td>

A function that returns an object containing `DataSource` instances for use by your resolvers. The object is automatically added to each operation's [`context`](#context).

For more details, see [Adding data sources to Apollo Server](../data/data-sources/#adding-data-sources-to-apollo-server).
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `cors`

`Object` or `Boolean`
</td>
<td>

An `Object` containing [configuration options](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) for the server's CORS behavior. Provide `false` to remove CORS middleware entirely.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `stopGracePeriodMillis`

`number`
</td>
<td>

The amount of time to wait after [`ApolloServer.stop()`](#stop) is called (including via a [termination signal](#stoponterminationsignals)) before forcefully closing all active connections. If you pass `Infinity`, Apollo Server waits indefinitely for all active connections to go idle.

The default value is `10_000` (10 seconds).

### Middleware-specific `context` fields

The `context` object passed between Apollo Server resolvers automatically includes certain fields, depending on which [Node.js middleware](../integrations/middleware/) you're using:

| Middleware | Context fields |
|---|---|
| Express (including `apollo-server`) | <code>{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;req: [`express.Request`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/50adc95acf873e714256074311353232fcc1b5ed/types/express-serve-static-core/index.d.ts),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;res: [`express.Response`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/50adc95acf873e714256074311353232fcc1b5ed/types/express-serve-static-core/index.d.ts#L490-L861)<br/>}</code> |
