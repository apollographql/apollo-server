title: "API Reference: Landing page plugins"
sidebar_title: Landing pages
api_reference: true
---

This API reference documents built-in plugins that add a landing page to Apollo Server's base URL, enabling visitors to interact with the server from their browser.

This includes plugins for:

* The default landing page for [non-production environments](#default-non-production-landing-page) (`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault`)
* The default landing page for [production](#default-production-landing-page) (`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault`)
* Using [GraphQL Playground](#graphql-playground-landing-page) as a landing page (`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground`)
* [Disabling the landing page entirely](#disabling-the-landing-page)

These plugins work by implementing the [`renderLandingPage`](../../integrations/plugins-event-reference/#renderlandingpage) plugin event, which serves an HTML page whenever a browser includes an `accept: text/html` header. Aside from these, you can also create a  [custom plugin](../../integrations/plugins/) that renders a [custom landing page](../../testing/build-run-queries/#custom-landing-page).
 
## Default behavior

If you don't manually install any plugin that implements `renderLandingPage`, Apollo Server does the following by default:

* In non-production environments (`NODE_ENV` is not `production`), Apollo Server installs `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault`.
* In production environments (`NODE_ENV` _is_ `production`), Apollo Server installs `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault`.

In either case, Apollo Server provides no configuration options to the plugin. You only need to install one of these plugins manually if you want to override its default configuration.

### Configuring default landing pages

To configure these default plugins while still using same `NODE_ENV`-based logic, import them from the `apollo-server-core` package and pass them to the `ApolloServer` constructor in the `plugins` array:

```js
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server";
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault,
         ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault
} from "apollo-server-core";

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    // Install a landing page plugin based on NODE_ENV
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault({
          graphRef: "my-graph-id@my-graph-variant",
          footer: false,
        })
      : ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ footer: false }),
  ],
});
```

Available configuration options are listed in each plugin's reference below.

## Default non-production landing page

The `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault` plugin shows a landing page welcoming you to Apollo Server:

<img class="screenshot" src="../../images/as-landing-page.jpg" alt="Apollo Server default landing page" width="350"/>

This landing page is designed for use in local development, where `NODE_ENV` is not set to `production`. It provides a copyable command-line snippet showing how to run operations via `curl`, and it also links to Apollo Sandbox (a hosted GraphQL IDE that runs entirely inside your browser and doesn't require an account).

### Options

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>

###### `version`

`string`
</td>
<td>

By default, this plugin uses the latest version of the landing page published to Apollo's CDN. If you'd like to pin the current version, you can specify it here.

The current latest version is available at [this link](https://apollo-server-landing-page.cdn.apollographql.com/_latest/version.txt).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `footer`

`boolean`
</td>
<td>

By default, the landing page displays a footer that links to the documentation telling you how to configure it. To remove this footer, pass `footer: false`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


## Default production landing page

The `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault` shows a minimalist landing page:

<img class="screenshot" src="../../images/as-landing-page-production.jpg" alt="Apollo Server default landing page" width="350"/>

This landing page is designed for use in production. It provides a copyable command-line snippet showing how to run operations with your server. By default, the only visible reference to Apollo is a footer explaining how to customize the page. You can also configure it to add a link to query your graph with the Apollo Studio Explorer.

### Options

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>

###### `version`

`string`
</td>
<td>

By default, this plugin uses the latest version of the landing page published to Apollo's CDN. If you'd like to pin the current version, you can specify it here.

The current latest version is available at [this link](https://apollo-server-landing-page.cdn.apollographql.com/_latest/version.txt).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `footer`

`boolean`
</td>
<td>

By default, the landing page displays a footer that links to the documentation telling you how to configure it. To remove this footer, pass `footer: false`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `graphRef`

`string`
</td>
<td>

If provided, the landing page includes a link (with opt-in auto-redirect) to the Apollo Studio page for the graph with the corresponding [graph ref](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/conventions/#graph-refs). An example graph ref is `my-graph@my-variant`.

To enable this link, you need to provide `graphRef` here even if you already provide it elsewhere for usage reporting and other purposes. This is because if your server is publicly accessible, you might not want to display the graph ref publicly.

## GraphQL Playground landing page

The `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` plugin serves the [GraphQL Playground IDE](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) as a landing page.

> **Note:** The GraphQL Playground project is [retired](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/issues/1143) in favor of GraphiQL. This functionality is provided to help developers migrating from Apollo Server 2.

The GraphQL Playground plugin is not installed by default. To install it, import it from `apollo-server-core` and provide it to the `ApolloServer` constructor:

```js
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server";
import {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground
} from "apollo-server-core";

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground(),
  ],
});
```

This plugin takes the same arguments as the [`renderPlaygroundPage` function](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-playground/blob/apollo/packages/graphql-playground-html/src/render-playground-page.ts#L63) from the `graphql-playground-html` package (or specifically, the `@apollographql/graphql-playground-html` fork).

[The table below](#options-2) mentions a few of the more common options and is not exhaustive.

### Options

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>

###### `version`

`string`
</td>
<td>

By default, this plugin loads a specific npm version of `@apollographql/graphql-playground-react` from a CDN. The version is hard-coded in `apollo-server-core` and is typically incremented when new versions of the Playground fork are released (this is rare because the project is retired). 

You can specify a different version here.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `endpoint`

`string`
</td>
<td>

By default, GraphQL Playground connects to a GraphQL server hosted at the same URL as Playground itself. To specify a different GraphQL endpoint, use this option.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `settings`

`Object`
</td>
<td>

If specified, allows you to override the default values of GraphQL Playground's settings. Documentation of supported settings is available in [GraphQL Playground's README](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground#settings).

</td>
</tr>


</tbody>
</table>

## Disabling the landing page

The `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled` plugin serves _no_ landing page from Apollo Server's base URL. Install it to disable the default landing page in some or all environments:

```js
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server";
import {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled
} from "apollo-server-core";

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled(),
  ],
});
```

This plugin takes no arguments.
