## Using the plugin

This API reference documents the `ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer` plugin.

This plugin is designed for use with [`apollo-server-express` and other framework-specific packages](../../integrations/middleware/#all-supported-packages) which are built on top of [Node `http.Server`s](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server). It is highly recommended that you use this plugin with packages like `apollo-server-express` if you want your server to shut down gracefully.

You do not need to explicitly use this plugin with the batteries-included `apollo-server` package: that package automatically uses this plugin internally.

When you use this plugin, Apollo Server will drain your HTTP server when you call the `stop()` method (which is also called for you when the `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals are received, unless disabled with the [`stopOnTerminationSignals` constructor option](../apollo-server/#stoponterminationsignals)). Specifically, it will:

* Stop listening for new connections
* Close idle connections (i.e., connections with no current HTTP request)
* Close active connections whenever they become idle
* Wait for all connections to be closed
* After a grace period, if any connections remain active, forcefully close them.

This plugin is exported from the `apollo-server-core` package. It is tested with `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-koa`, and `apollo-server-fastify`. (If you're using Hapi, you should instead use the `ApolloServerPluginStopHapiServer` plugin exported from the `apollo-server-hapi` package.)

Here's a basic example of how to use it with Express. See the [framework integrations docs](../../integrations/middleware/) for examples of how to use it with other frameworks.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts:title=index.ts
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const { ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer } = require('apollo-server-core');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./schema');
const http = require('http');

async function startApolloServer() {
  const app = express();
  const httpServer = http.createServer(app);
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    plugins: [ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({ httpServer })],
  });

  await server.start();

  // Mount Apollo middleware here.
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });
  await new Promise<void>(resolve => httpServer.listen({ port: 4000 }, resolve));
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`);
  return { server, app };
}
```
