## `buildFederatedSchema`

The `@apollo/federation` has one export for intended public use, the `buildFederatedSchema` function. This function is designed to take a list of GraphQL schema modules (i.e. `{ typeDefs: DocumentNode, resolvers: ResolverMap }`) and turn them into a federation ready schema.

#### Parameters

* `modules`: `GraphQLSchemaModule[]` _(required)_

    An array of schema modules made up of typeDefs and resolvers.

#### Usage

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }){
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildFederatedSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }])
});
```

## `__resolveReference`

Though not an export from `@apollo/federation`, using the `buildFederatedSchema` function allows a resolver map to define a new special field called `__resolveReference` for each type that is an entity. This function is called whenever an entity is requested as part of the fufilling a query plan. `__resolveReference` is called with the following parameters:

#### Parameters

* `reference`: `Object`

  The reference passed from another service. Will always contain at least the `__typename` and the primary key of the entity.

* `context`: `Object`

  The context object generated by Apollo Server including `DataSources` if used.

* `info`: `GraphQLResolveInfo`

   This argument contains information about the execution state of the query, including the field name, path to the field from the root, and more. It is currently only documented in the [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/c82ff68f52722c20f10da69c9e50a030a1f218ae/src/type/definition.js#L489-L500) source code.

#### Usage

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { datasources }){
      // user will always have at least the `id` and the `__typename` here
      return datasources.users.fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
};
```
