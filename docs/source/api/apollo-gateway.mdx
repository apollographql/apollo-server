## `ApolloGateway`

The core class of Apollo Server's federated gateway implementation. For an
example of using `ApolloGateway`, see [The gateway](/federation/gateway/).

### `constructor(options)`: `ApolloGateway`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  An object that contains configuration options for the gateway.

  Supported options include:

  * `serviceList`: `ServiceDefinition[]`

    > **Do not provide this option if you are using [managed configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/federation/#managed-configuration).** If you
    > are _not_ using managed configuration, this option is **required**.

    An array representing the implementing services that the gateway will use
    to resolve incoming GraphQL operations. Each object in the array specifies
    the `name` and `url` of an implementing service in your federated graph.
    You can specify any string value for the `name` field, which is used for
    identifying the service in log output and error messages, and for reporting
    metrics to Apollo Graph Manager.

    ```js{3-6}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      serviceList: [
        { name: 'products', url: 'https://products-service.dev/graphql' },
        { name: 'reviews', url: 'https://reviews-service.dev/graphql' }
      ]
    });
    ```

  * `apq`: `Boolean`

    When enabled the gateway will attempt to use [automated persisted queries (APQ)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/)
    when sending queries to downstream services.  Depending on the complexity
    of queries sent to downstream services, this technique can greatly reduce
    the size of the payloads being transmitted over the network.  Downstream
    implementing services must also support APQ functionality to participate
    in this feature (Apollo Server does by default unless it has been
    explicitly disabled).  As with typical APQ behavior, a downstream server
    must have received and registered a query once before it will be able to
    serve an APQ request.

  * `buildService`: `(service: ServiceDefinition) => GraphQLDataSource`

    Define this function to customize your gateway's data transport to some or
    all of your data graph's implementing services. This customization can
    include using a protocol besides the default of HTTP.

    If you provide this function, `ApolloGateway` calls it for every
    implementing service in your data graph. The function must return an object
    that implements the [`GraphQLDataSource` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/packages/apollo-gateway/src/datasources/types.ts), such as an instance of [RemoteGraphQLDataSource](#remotegraphqldatasource) or a subclass of it.

    The example below demonstrates adding an `x-user-id`
    HTTP header to every request the gateway sends to an implementing service:

    ```js{1-5,9-11}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    }

    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      buildService({ name, url }) {
        return new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
      },
    });
    ```

  * `introspectionHeaders`: `{ [key: string]: string }`

    An object containing HTTP headers that the gateway will include _only_ when
    obtaining schema definitions from each of your implementing services.

    > **Note:** If you define a `buildService` function, you should specify these headers
    > in that function instead of including this option. This ensures that your `buildService` function doesn't inadvertently overwrite the values of any headers
    > you provide via this option.

    ```js{3-5}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      introspectionHeaders: {
        Authorization: 'my-header'
      }
    });
    ```

  * `logger`: `Logger`

    A logging implementation to be used in place of `console`.  The implementation must provide the methods which satisfy the requirements of [the `Logger` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/80a12d89ea1ae9a0892f4a81d9213eddf95ca965/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L114-L121) (i.e. it must provide `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error` methods).  When a custom logger is provided, it will receive all levels of logging and it is up to the logger itself to determine how it wishes to handle each level.  When a custom logger is _not_ provided, Gateway will default to outputting `warn` and `error` levels unless `debug: true` is specified,  in which case it will output all log levels (i.e. `debug` through `error`).

    Additionally, this `logger` will be made available on the `GraphQLRequestContext` and available to plugins.  This allows a plugin to, e.g., augment the logger on a per-request basis within the `requestDidStart` life-cycle hook.

  * `debug`: `Boolean`

    If `true`, the gateway logs startup messages, along with the query plan for
    each incoming request. The default value is `false`.

  * `fetcher`: `typeof fetch`

    When specified, overrides the default
    [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api) implementation
    which is used when communicating with downstream services.  By default,
    [`make-fetch-happen`](https://npm.im/make-fetch-happen) is used with its
    own defaults.  Another compliant implementation can be provided
    (e.g. [`node-fetch`](https://npm.im/node-fetch) by setting
    `fetcher: require('node-fetch')`) or different [default options for
    `make-fetch-happen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/make-fetch-happen#extra-options)
    can be defined entirely. E.g.:

    ```javascript
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      /* ... */
      fetcher: require('make-fetch-happen').defaults({
        onRetry() {
          console.log('we will retry!')
        },
      }),
      /* ... */
    });
    ```

  * `serviceHealthCheck`: `boolean`

    When set to true, the gateway will issue a small query (`{ __typename }`) to
    its downstream services on load and on schema update. On load, the gateway
    will throw an error if any of the requests fail. On schema update, the
    gateway will not roll over to the new schema or service configuration if any
    of the requests fail, but it will try again at the next poll interval.

  * `experimental_approximateQueryPlanStoreMiB`: `number`

    > **This property is experimental.**  It may be removed or change at any time, even within a patch release.

    When set, this sets the approximate size of the query plan store (in MiB).
    This cache is used to save query plans for re-use on subsequent queries
    which resolve to the same `queryHash` (a SHA-256 of incoming operation).

    When this property is omitted, the cache is still enabled with a default
    size of 30MiB, which is generally sufficient unless the server is
    processing a high number of unique operations.

#### Returns

An `ApolloGateway` instance, which you then pass as the `gateway` configuration option to the `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway: new ApolloGateway({ serviceList: [...] }),
});
```

### `serviceHealthCheck`

Calling this function on the gateway will issue a small query (`{ __typename }`)
to each downstream service to ensure they are all responsive. This function
`throw`s on failure and returns a `Promise` to be `await`ed.

#### Parameters

* `serviceMap`: `DataSourceMap`

  A map of data sources can optionally be provided to this function in order to
  modify where the health checks will be issued. By default, the gateway will
  use the existing `this.serviceMap` for issuing the health check requests.

## `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

A `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` object represents a connection between your
federated gateway and _one_ of your implementing services.

You can customize this connection by defining a subclass of this class and
overriding its `willSendRequest` and/or `didReceiveResponse` methods:

* The `willSendRequest` method lets you modify your gateway's requests to the implementing service before they're sent.
* The `didReceiveResponse` method lets you modify the implementing service's responses before the gateway passes them along to the requesting client.

These methods are described in detail below.

### `constructor(options)`: `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  An object that contains configuration options for the data source.

  Supported options include:

  * `url`: `string` _(required)_

    The implementing service's URL for sending fetch requests via HTTP.

  ### `willSendRequest`: `(requestContext: {request: GraphQLRequest, context: Record<string, any>}) => Promise<void>`

    Override this method to customize the structure of each fetch that's sent
    to the implementing service. The method accepts an object that contains
    both the original incoming `request` and the current `context`.

    The example below demonstrates using the `willSendRequest` method to
    add an `x-user-id` HTTP header to every request the gateway sends to an implementing service:

    ```js{2-4}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    });
    ```

  ### `didReceiveResponse`: `(requestContext: {request: GraphQLRequest, response: GraphQLResponse, context: Record<string, any>}) => Promise<GraphQLResponse>`

    Override this method to customize the gateway's behavior after completing
    a fetch to the implementing service. The method receives an object (a
    [`GraphQLRequestContext`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/2562d096/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L61-L92))
    containing the `request` (a `GraphQLRequest`), the implementing service's
    `response` (a `GraphQLResponse`), and the current `context` as parameters.
    This allows modification of the context and the final result of the fetch.

    The `http` property on the `request` and `response` objects will contain
    additional HTTP-specific properties, like `headers`.

    Any implementation of this method must return an object that matches the
    structure of a [`GraphQLResponse`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/2562d096/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L43-L48)
    (i.e., it should include `http`, `data`, `errors`, and/or `extensions`
    fields).  If no modifications are necessary, simply return the original
    `response`.

    ```javascript
    class CookieDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      didReceiveResponse({ response, request, context }) {
        const cookie = request.http.headers.get('Cookie');
        if (cookie) {
          context.responseCookies.push(cookie);
        }

        // Return the response back, even when unchanged.
        return response;
      }
    }
    ```
