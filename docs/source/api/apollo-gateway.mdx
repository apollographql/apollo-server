## `ApolloGateway`

The core class of Apollo Server's federated gateway implementation. For an
example of using `ApolloGateway`, see [Implementing a federated graph](/federation/implementing/).

### `constructor(options)`: `ApolloGateway`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  An object that contains configuration options for the gateway.

  Supported options include:

  * `serviceList`: `ServiceDefinition[]`

    > **Do not provide this option if you are using [managed configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/federation/#managed-configuration).** If you
    > are _not_ using managed configuration, this option is **required**.

    An array representing the implementing services that the gateway will use
    to resolve incoming GraphQL operations. Each object in the array specifies
    the `name` and `url` of an implementing service in your federated graph.
    You can specify any string value for the `name` field, which is used for
    identifying the service in log output and error messages, and for reporting
    metrics to Apollo Graph Manager.

    ```js{3-6}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      serviceList: [
        { name: 'products', url: 'https://products-service.dev/graphql' },
        { name: 'reviews', url: 'https://reviews-service.dev/graphql' }
      ]
    });
    ```

  * `buildService`: `(service: ServiceDefinition) => GraphQLDataSource`

    Define this function to customize your gateway's data transport to some or
    all of your data graph's implementing services. This customization can
    include using a protocol besides the default of HTTP.

    If you provide this function, `ApolloGateway` calls it for every
    implementing service in your data graph. The function must return a `GraphQLDataSource` object.

    The example below demonstrates adding an `x-user-id`
    HTTP header to every request the gateway sends to an implementing service:

    ```js{1-5,9-11}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    }

    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      buildService({ name, url }) {
        return new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
      },
    });
    ```

  * `introspectionHeaders`: `{ [key: string]: string }`

    An object containing HTTP headers that the gateway will include _only_ when
    obtaining schema definitions from each of your implementing services.

    > **Note:** If you define a `buildService` function, you should specify these headers
    > in that function instead of using this option.

    ```js{3-5}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      introspectionHeaders: {
        Authorization: 'my-header'
      }
    });
    ```

  * `debug`: `Boolean`

    If `true`, the gateway logs startup messages, along with the query plan for
    each incoming request. The default value is `false`.

#### Returns

An `ApolloGateway` instance, which you then pass as the `gateway` configuration option to the `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway: new ApolloGateway({ serviceList: [...] }),
});
```

## `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

A `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` object represents a connection between your
federated gateway and _one_ of your implementing services. You can customize
this connection in two different ways:

* Define a `willSendRequest` function that lets you modify your gateway's requests to the implementing service before they're sent.
* Define a `didReceiveResponse` function that lets you modify the implementing service's responses before the gateway passes them along to the requesting client.

### `constructor(options)`: `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  An object that contains configuration options for the data source.

  Supported options include:

  * `url`: `string` _(required)_

    The implementing service's URL for sending fetch requests via HTTP.

  * `willSendRequest`: `(requestContext: {request: GraphQLRequest, context: Record<string, any>}) => Promise<void>`

    Define this function to customize the structure of each fetch that's sent
    to the implementing service. The function accepts an object that contains
    both the original incoming `request` and the current `context`.

    The example below demonstrates using the `willSendRequest` function to
    add an `x-user-id` HTTP header to every request the gateway sends to an implementing service:

    ```js{2-4}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    });
    ```

  * `didReceiveResponse`: `(response: Response, request: Request, context: TContext) => Promise<TResult>`

    Define this function to customize the gateway's behavior after completing
    a fetch to the implementing service. The function takes the original `request`, the implementing service's `response`, and the current `context` as parameters, allowing you to modify any combination of the context and the final result of the fetch.

    This function must return a parsed response body.

    ```js{2-9}
    class CookieDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      didReceiveResponse(response, request, context) {
        const body = super.didReceiveResponse(response, request, context);
        const cookie = request.http.headers.get('Cookie');
        if (cookie) {
          context.responseCookies.push(cookie);
        }
        return body;
      }
    }
    ```
