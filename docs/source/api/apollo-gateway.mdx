description: Apollo Gateway API reference
---

This API reference documents the exports from the `@apollo/gateway`.


## `ApolloGateway`

The core of the federated gateway implementation. For an example, see the ["implementing"](/federation/implementing/) section.

### `constructor(options)`: `ApolloGateway`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  * `serviceList`: `ServiceDefinition[]` _(must **not** be set when using [managed federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/federation/#managed-configuration); **required otherwise**)_

    > To reduce the possibility of different server instances using different configurations during a roll-out, we recommend using a managed configuration that provides a single single source of truth for a graph.  When using [Graph Manager](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/graph-manager-overview/)'s [managed federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/federation/#managed-configuration) feature, this is handled automatically and `serviceList` should not be specified.

    An array of service definitions. A service definition contains the `name` and `url` for a federated service. The name is an arbitrary unique string and is primarily used for query planner output, error messages, logging, and the like.

    ```js{3-6}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      serviceList: [
        { name: 'products', url: 'https://products-service.dev/graphql' },
        { name: 'reviews', url: 'https://reviews-service.dev/graphql' }
      ]
    });
    ```

  * `buildService`: `(service: ServiceDefinition) => GraphQLDataSource`

    A function to be called for each service in `options.serviceList`.
    The `service` is provided as an argument, and a `GraphQLDataSource` is expected to be returned.
    Allows for customizing transports.

    ```js{1-5,9-11}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    }

    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      buildService({ name, url }) {
        return new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
      },
    });
    ```
  * `introspectionHeaders`: `{ [key: string]: string }`

    An object containing headers sent with introspection queries

    ```js{3-5}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      introspectionHeaders: {
        Authorization: 'my-header'
      }
    });
    ```

  * `debug`: `Boolean`

    With debug enabled, the server will log startup messages as well as query plans during incoming requests.

#### Returns

An `ApolloGateway` instance, which is intended to be passed as the `gateway` configuration option of `ApolloServer` like so:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway: new ApolloGateway({ serviceList: [...] }),
});
```

## RemoteGraphQLDataSource

The `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` export is used to connect to underlying federated services from the gateway. It allows for customizations of its request using the `willSendRequest` function. By default, the `ApolloGateway` creates a new `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` for each service using the `url` from the service definition as its target location.

### `constructor(options)`: `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  * `url`: `string` _(required)_

    The location of the service to fetch using an HTTP request.

  * `willSendRequest`: `(request: GraphQLRequest) => Promise<void>`

    A function to be called on every fetch to the underlying GraphQL service. This method takes information about the incoming request, as well as the context from Apollo Server, to allow for customizing the request.

    ```js{2-4}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    });
    ```

  * `didReceiveResponse`: `(response: Response, request: Request, context: TContext) => Promise<TResult>`

    A function to be called after completing a fetch to the underlying GraphQL service. This method has access to the request, response, and Apollo Server context to allow for updating the context or modifying the final result. This function expects a parsed response to be returned.

    ```js{2-9}
    class CookieDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      didReceiveResponse(response, request, context) {
        const body = super.didReceiveResponse(response, request, context);
        const cookie = request.http.headers.get('Cookie');
        if (cookie) {
          context.responseCookies.push(cookie);
        }
        return body;
      }
    }
    ```
