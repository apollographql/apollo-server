## End-of-life versions

Apollo no longer commits to providing any support for these versions. While you may still file issues about security concerns or significant regressions, Apollo may choose not to address them.

End-of-life versions will remain available in the npm registry and can still be installed and used in your projects. However, Apollo doesn't guarantee any further support for them, nor does Apollo recommend their use. Additionally, Apollo doesn't guarantee that GraphOS features will continue to work for packages beyond their end-of-life date.

### Apollo Server 3

[Apollo Server 3](/apollo-server/v3/) is end-of-life as of **October 22, 2024**. We encourage all Apollo Server 3 users to [**upgrade** to Apollo Server 4 now](./migration) as _soon as possible_.

Note that Apollo Server 2 and 3 were distributed in various npm packages (such as `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-core`, and `apollo-server-express`); Apollo Server 4 combines these packages into a single new [`@apollo/server` package](./migration/#the-new-apolloserver-package).

### Apollo Server 2

[Apollo Server 2](/apollo-server/v2/) is end-of-life as of **October 22, 2023**. We encourage all users of Apollo Server 2 to **upgrade** to Apollo Server 4 as _soon as possible_, first by following the [v3 migration guide](/apollo-server/v3/migration) and then following the [v4 migration guide](./migration).

Note that Apollo Server 2 and 3 were distributed in various npm packages (such as `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-core`, and `apollo-server-express`); Apollo Server 4 combines these packages into a single new [`@apollo/server` package](./migration/#the-new-apolloserver-package).

Depending on which Apollo Server features you use, the upgrade process might require several changes to your server. The most straightforward upgrade path is to first upgrade from Apollo Server 2 to 3, then once everything works, continue upgrading from Apollo Server 3 to 4.

### Apollo Server 1

Apollo Server 1 was a significantly different project and has been considered end-of-life since 2018.
