## Apollo Server 5 is generally available

Apollo Server 5 is the latest version of Apollo Server and is [generally available](/resources/product-launch-stages#general-availability). Apollo Server 5 is ready for use in a production environment, and Apollo provides official support for this library. There is currently no planned end-of-life date.

// FIXME: add deprecation / EOL details for AS4 once they are decided on

## Deprecated versions

> [Learn more about deprecation and end-of-life.](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/product-launch-stages#stages-for-discontinuing-support)

Both previous major versions of Apollo Server are currently [deprecated](/resources/product-launch-stages#deprecated), with end-of-life scheduled for **October 22nd, 2023**. Additionally, [certain features](#apollo-server-2) of Apollo Server 2 have reached their end-of-life date of **December 31st, 2022**.

Deprecated versions continue to receive security patches and updates to address major regressions until their end-of-life date. They typically do not receive new features and other kinds of bug fixes may or may not be backported to deprecated versions at Apollo's discretion.

End-of-life versions will remain available in the npm registry and can still be installed and used in your projects. However, Apollo doesn't guarantee any further support for them, nor does Apollo recommend their use. Additionally, Apollo doesn't guarantee that GraphOS features will continue to work for packages beyond their end-of-life date.

### Apollo Server 4

// FIXME: confirm AS4 belongs in ## Deprecated section
// FIXME: plug in EOL date for AS4

[Apollo Server 4](/apollo-server/v4/) is deprecated and will transition to end-of-life on **TBD**. We encourage all Apollo Server 4 users to [**upgrade** to Apollo Server 5 now](./migration). The upgrade from v4 should take only a few minutes and require little to no changes.

### Apollo Server 3

[Apollo Server 3](/apollo-server/v3/) is deprecated and will transition to end-of-life on **October 22nd, 2023**. We encourage all Apollo Server 3 users to [**upgrade** to Apollo Server 4 now](./migration). Note that Apollo Server 2 and 3 were distributed in various npm packages (such as `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-core`, and `apollo-server-express`); Apollo Server 4 combines these packages into a single new [`@apollo/server` package](./migration/#the-new-apolloserver-package).

### Apollo Server 2

[Apollo Server 2](/apollo-server/v2/) is deprecated and will transition to end-of-life on **October 22, 2023**. We encourage all users of Apollo Server 2 to **upgrade** to Apollo Server 4, first by following the [v3 migration guide](/apollo-server/v3/migration) and then following the [v4 migration guide](./migration). Note that Apollo Server 2 and 3 were distributed in various npm packages (such as `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-core`, and `apollo-server-express`); Apollo Server 4 combines these packages into a single new [`@apollo/server` package](./migration/#the-new-apolloserver-package).

We recommend upgrading to Apollo Server 4 as _soon as possible_. Depending on which Apollo Server features you use, the upgrade process might require several changes to your server. The most straightforward upgrade path is to first upgrade from Apollo Server 2 to 3, then once everything works, continue upgrading from Apollo Server 3 to 4.

Three features of Apollo Server 2 have reached their end-of-life date as of **December 31st, 2022**. These three features are:
* [Subscriptions](/apollo-server/v2/data/subscriptions/)
* [File uploads](/apollo-server/v2/data/file-uploads/)
* [GraphQL Playground](/apollo-server/v2/testing/graphql-playground/).

As of 2023, Apollo no longer commits to providing any support for these three features. While you may still file issues about security concerns or significant regressions, if the problems do not exist when a server is initialized with `new ApolloServer({ subscriptions: false, uploads: false, playground: false })`, Apollo may choose not to address them.

### Apollo Server 1

Apollo Server 1 was a significantly different project and has been considered end-of-life since 2018.
