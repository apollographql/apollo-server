> Looking to generate types for your [Apollo Federation](/federation/) subgraphs? Our [Subgraph Template](https://github.com/apollographql/subgraph-template-typescript-apollo-server) lays down the ground work so you can quickly set up a subgraph with generated types.



## Setting up your project

The first thing you'll need is a `.graphql` file containing your schema, if you already have your schema in a `.graphql` file feel free to [skip this step](#installing-dependencies).

Create a `.graphql` file and move your project's GraphQL schema inside. For example:


you'll want to begin by setting up creating a `.graphql` file and moving your schema into it. 

## Installing dependencies

The first step is to install the packages you'll need to generate types for your resolvers based of your schema:

```bash
npm install -D @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers
```

With those packages installed, you'll can now set up a configuration file telling GraphQL Code Generator where and how to generate types. You can do this by using `npx graphql-code-generator init` or manually create a `codegen.yml` file.

Below is an example of a `codegen.yaml` file:

```yml
# This configuration file tells GraphQL Code Generator how to generate types based on our schema.
schema: "./schema.graphql"
generates:
  # Specify where our generated types should live.
  ./src/__generated__/resolvers-types.ts:
    plugins:
      - "typescript"
      - "typescript-resolvers"
    config:
      useIndexSignature: true
    # We can specify a type for the context shared by our resolvers, more on this below.  
      contextType: ../index#MyContext
```

> See the [GraphQL Code Generator docs](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript-resolvers#usage-example) for more information on the configuration options of GraphQL Code Generator.

Next you'll want to add scripts to your `package.json` file to ensure your types are generated regularly:

```json
{
// ...
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npm run compile",
    "compile": "tsc && graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml",
    "start": "npm run compile && node ./dist/index.js",
  },
// ...
}
```

Now we are ready to start using the types we generated!

## Set up typing for resolvers

The `typescript-resolvers` plugin creates a `Resolvers` type that you can import directly into the file where you are importing your resolvers:

```ts


```


### Add context type for resolvers
You can manually provide `contextValue` typing for your resolvers, like so

```ts

```

Or you can provide a context value for all of your resolvers by specifying a `contextType` in your `codegen.yaml`:

```yaml
# This configuration file tells GraphQL Code Generator how to generate types based on our schema.
schema: "./schema.graphql"
generates:
  ./src/__generated__/resolvers-types.ts:
    plugins:
      - "typescript"
      - "typescript-resolvers"
    config:
      useIndexSignature: true
      # Providing our context's interface ensures our context's type is set for
      # all of our resolvers. 
      # This file path starts from location of the file where you generate
      # types (i.e., `/src/__generated__/resolvers-types.ts` above) 
      contextType: ../index#MyContext
```

Now your context is automatically typed in all of your resolvers:

```ts

```
