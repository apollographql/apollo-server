[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (CORS) is an HTTP-header-based protocol that enables a server to dictate which origins can access its resources. Put another way, your server can specify which websites can tell a user's browser to talk to your server, and precisely which types of HTTP requests are allowed.

Apollo Server's default CORS behavior enables any website on the internet to tell a user's browser to connect to your server.

> ⚠️ If your app is only visible on a private network and uses network separation for security, the default CORS behavior is **not secure**. See [Specifying origins](#specifying-origins) for more information.

By default, websites running on domains that differ from your server's domain can't pass cookies with their requests. For details on enabling cross-origin cookie passing for authentication, see [Passing credentials with CORS](#passing-credentials-with-cors).

## Why use CORS?

Most developers know about CORS because they run into the all-too-common [CORS error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors). CORS errors usually occur when you set up an API call or try to get your separately hosted server and client to talk to each other. To better understand what CORS is and why we use it, we'll briefly go over some background context.

Internet users should always exercise caution when installing any new software on their devices. But when it comes to browsing the web, we navigate to different sites all the time, letting our browsers load content from those sites along the way. This comes with inherent risks.

As web developers, we don't want a user's browser to do anything fishy to our server while the user is visiting another website. Browser security mechanisms (e.g., CORS or SOP) can give developers peace of mind by enabling a website's server to specify which browser origins can request resources from that server.

The [_origin_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#definition_of_an_origin) of a piece of web content consists of that content's domain, protocol, and port. The [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) (SOP) is a security mechanism that restricts scripts on one origin from interacting with resources from another origin. This means that scripts on websites can interact with resources from the same origin without jumping through any extra hoops.

If two URLs differ in their domain, protocol, or port, then those URLs come from two different origins:

```bash
# Same origin
http://example.com:8080/ <==> http://example.com:8080/

# Different origin (difference in domain, protocol, and port)
http://example.com:8080/ =X= https://example1.com:8081/
```

However, as we all know, the internet is an exciting place full of resources that can make websites better (importing images, extra fonts, making API calls, and so on).  Developers needed a new protocol to relax SOP and safely _share_ resources across different origins.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is the mechanism that allows a web page to share resources across different origins. CORS provides an extra layer of protection by enabling servers and clients to define HTTP headers that specify _which_ external clients' scripts can access their resources.

Note that both SOP and CORS are related to [_browser_ security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security#security-related_glossary_terms). Neither prevents _other_ types of software from requesting resources from your server.

## Choosing CORS options for your project

When thinking about configuring CORS for your application, there are two main settings to consider:

* Which origins can access your server's resources
* Whether your server accepts user credentials (i.e., cookies) with requests

### Specifying origins

CORS uses [specific HTTP request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#the_http_response_headers) as part of its protocol, including [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin). The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (ACAO) enables a server to dictate which origins can use scripts to access that server's resources.

Depending on what you're building, the origins you specify in your CORS configuration might need to change when you're ready to deploy your application.

#### ⚠️ Applications on private networks

If your browser is running your API on a private network (i.e., not on the public internet) and it relies on the privacy of that network for security, **the default CORS behavior of Apollo Server is insecure**. We strongly recommend [specifying which origins](#configuring-cors-options-for-apollo-server) can access your server's resources.

If you don't, while your personal computer is on your private network, a script on any website could potentially make your browser talk to your private API. [Some browsers, such as Chrome, have features under development](https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/) to solve this problem. But in the meantime, all servers on private networks should *always* specify origins in their CORS configuration.

#### Federated subgraphs

If you're building a [federated graph](/federation/), we strongly recommend that _all_ of your production subgraph servers [_disable_ CORS](../api/apollo-server#cors) (or at least specify origins and limit them to tools like the Apollo Explorer). Most subgraphs should allow communication _only_ from your gateways, and that communication doesn't involve a browser at all.

For more information, see [Securing your subgraphs](/federation/subgraphs/#securing-your-subgraphs).

#### APIs that require cookies

If your API needs to accept [cross-origin cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) with requests, you _must_ specify origins in your CORS configuration. Otherwise, cross-origin cookies are automatically disabled. This is _not_ a security vulnerability, but it does prevent your API from successfully providing cookies.

For examples, see [Passing credentials with CORS](#passing-credentials-with-cors).

#### APIs with known consumers

If you create an API on the public internet to serve resources to your _own_ websites or apps, you might want to [specify which origins](#configuring-cors-options-for-apollo-server) can access your server's resources. Explicitly specifying origins can provide an extra level of security.

#### Public or embedded APIs

If you create a public API or an API to embed in websites you don't control yourself, you probably want to allow _all_ origins to access your server's resources. You can use Apollo Server's default ACAO value (the wildcard `*`) in these situations, allowing requests from any origin.

> Using the [wildcard (`*`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin#directives) value for the ACAO header enables _any_ website to tell a user's browser to send an arbitrary request (without cookies or other credentials) to your server and read that server's response.

#### None of the above

If your application doesn't fit into any of the above categories, the default Apollo Server CORS behavior should suit your use case. You can always specify origins in your CORS configuration later or disable cross-origin requests by [disabling CORS for your server](../api/apollo-server#cors).

##  Configuring CORS options for Apollo Server

By default, the batteries-included `apollo-server` package serves the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP header with the wildcard value (`*`). This allows scripts on any origin to make requests, _without cookies_, to the server and read its responses.

> If you need to pass credentials to your server (e.g., via cookies), you can't use the wildcard value (`*`) for your origin. You _must_ provide specific origins. For examples, see [Passing credentials with CORS](#passing-credentials-with-cors).

The batteries-included `apollo-server` [has a `cors` option](../api/apollo-server/#cors), which you can use to change your server's default CORS behavior:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  cors: {
    origin: ["https://www.your-app.example", "https://studio.apollographql.com"]
  },
});
```

Under the hood, the batteries-included `apollo-server` wraps around middleware provided by the [`cors`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) npm package, enabling you to configure the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header via the `origin` option. The example above enables CORS requests from `https://www.your-app.example`, along with `https://studio.apollographql.com`.

> Note if you plan to use [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/explorer/) as a GraphQL web IDE you should include `https://studio.apollographql.com` in your list of valid origins.

If you're using another integration of Apollo Server, you can add the `cors` configuration option to your framework-specific middleware function to change your server's CORS behavior. To learn more about the CORS defaults and options for your integration of Apollo Server, see [CORS configuration options](../api/apollo-server/#cors-1).

Below is an example of setting up CORS with the [`apollo-server-express`](../integrations/middleware#swapping-out-apollo-server) package:

```js
// ... set up the server
await server.start();

const corsOptions = {
  origin: ["https://www.your-app.example", "https://studio.apollographql.com"]
};

server.applyMiddleware({
  app,
  cors: corsOptions,
  path: "/graphql",
});
```

You can also [remove CORS middleware entirely](../api/apollo-server#cors) to disable cross-origin requests. In the batteries-included `apollo-server` and `apollo-server-express`, you do this by passing `cors: false`. This is [recommended for subgraphs in a federated graph](/federation/subgraphs/#securing-your-subgraphs).

### Passing credentials with CORS

If your server requires requests to [include a user's credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#requests_with_credentials) (e.g., cookies), you need to modify your CORS configuration to tell the browser those credentials are allowed.

You can enable credentials with CORS by setting the [`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) HTTP header to `true`.

> You *must* [specify an origin](#configuring-cors-options-for-apollo-server) to enable credentialed requests. If your server sends the `*` wildcard value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP header, your browser will refuse to send credentials.

To  enable your browser to pass credentials with the batteries-included `apollo-server` you can use the [`cors` option](../api/apollo-server/#cors) to specify `origins` and set `credentials` to `true`:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  cors: {
    origin: yourOrigin,
    credentials: true
  },
});
```

Using `cors` middleware with an integration of Apollo Server, you can set the [`credentials`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) option to `true` before passing it to your [framework-specific middleware function](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server#framework-specific-middleware-function):

```js
//  The example below is using the apollo-server-express package.

// ... set up the server
await server.start();

const corsOptions = { origin: yourOrigin, credentials: true };

server.applyMiddleware({
  app,
  cors: corsOptions,
  path: "/graphql",
});
```

>The `cors` middleware `origin` option also accepts a boolean value, which means you can technically configure CORS to allow all cross-origin requests _with_ credentials (i.e., `{origin: true, credentials: true}`). This is almost certainly insecure, because any website could read information previously protected by a user's cookies. Instead, you should [specify origins in your CORS configuration](#configuring-cors-options-for-apollo-server) whenever you enable credentials.
