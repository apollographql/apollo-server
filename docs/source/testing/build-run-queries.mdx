title: Build and run queries against Apollo Server
---

In non-production environments, Apollo Server 4's landing page is an embedded version of [Apollo Sandbox](/studio/explorer/sandbox) (served at the `http://localhost:4000` by default):

> Apollo Server serves a different landing page [in production](#production-vs-non-production).

[Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox) is a powerful web IDE that enables you to build and run operations against your server (or any other reachable server). Sandbox is a special instance of the [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/) that doesn't require an Apollo account.

## Production vs. non-production

In production environments (when `NODE_ENV` is `production`), Apollo Server serves a different landing page:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../images/as-landing-page-production.jpg"
  alt="Apollo Server production landing page"
  width="400"
/>

This is partly because Apollo Server disables introspection in production by default, which means that tools like Apollo Sandbox don't work.

For this reason, if you choose to [change your Apollo Server landing page](#changing-the-landing-page), we recommend using different settings for production and non-production environments (potentially even [disabling your landing page](#disabling-the-landing-page) in production).

## Changing the landing page

You can change the landing page that's served from Apollo Server's base URL. In addition to [configuring the default landing page](#configuring-the-default-landing-page), you can serve [GraphQL Playground](#graphql-playground) (an open-source GraphQL IDE), a completely [custom landing page](#custom-landing-page), or you can [disable the landing page entirely](#disabling-the-landing-page).

You do this by installing one of a few different Apollo Server **plugins**.

### Configuring the default landing page

Apollo Server uses one of these plugins to display its default landing page, depending on the environment:

- `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault` (non-production environments)
- `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault` (production)

You can install either of these plugins manually to configure its behavior.

For example, below we set up our local environment to serve up a landing page with a non-embedded version of Apollo Sandbox:

```js title="index.js"
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
// highlight-start
import {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault,
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault,
} from '@apollo/server/plugin/landingPage/default';
// highlight-end

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    // highlight-start
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? ApolloServerPluginLandingPageProductionDefault()
      : ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: false }),
    // highlight-end
  ],
});
```

For all available configuration options for these plugins, [see the API reference](/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/).

### GraphQL Playground

> **Note:** The GraphQL Playground project has been [retired](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/issues/1143). Apollo Server provides an integration with GraphQL Playground to help developers migrate from Apollo Server 2 with as few changes as possible, but we do not recommend long-term use of this unmaintained project.

A previous version of Apollo Server (v2) serves GraphQL Playground from its base URL:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../images/playground.png"
  alt="GraphQL Playground"
/>

You can replicate this behavior in Apollo Server 4 by providing the following plugin to the `ApolloServer` constructor:

```js {1,7-9} title="index.js"
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } from '@apollo/server/plugin/landingPage/graphqlPlayground';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({
      // options
    }),
  ],
});
```

You can configure GraphQL Playground's behavior by [providing options to this plugin](/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/#graphql-playground-landing-page).

### Custom landing page

You can serve a custom HTML landing page from Apollo Server's base URL. To do so, define your own [custom plugin](/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/) that calls the [`renderLandingPage` method](../integrations/plugins-event-reference/#renderlandingpage), like so:

```js {5-22} title="index.js"
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async renderLandingPage() {
            const html = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>`;
            return { html };
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Disabling the landing page

You can disable Apollo Server's landing page by providing the following plugin to the `ApolloServer` constructor:

```js {1,7} title="index.js"
const { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled } = require('apollo-server-core');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled()],
});
```
