[GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) is a graphical, interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE, created by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and based on [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

<ExpansionPanel title="ðŸ“£ Interested in alpha-testing a new local querying tool from Apollo?">

We're testing a new local development feature in Apollo Studio called **dev graphs**. Dev graphs enable you to use Studio's powerful Explorer to query your locally running server.

To try out dev graphs:

1. If you don't already have a (completely free) Apollo Studio account, visit [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com) to create one.
2. Visit [studio.apollographql.com/dev](https://studio.apollographql.com/dev). Specify a name, endpoint (`http://localhost:4000`), and organization for your dev graph.
    * Note that your server must currently be running at the specified endpoint to create your dev graph.
3. Try running operations on your server using the Explorer. For an overview of Explorer features, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8b0Bda_TIw).
4. Please share your feedback with us at **feedback@apollographql.com**. Thank you!

In development, Apollo Server enables GraphQL Playground on the same URL as the GraphQL server itself (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/graphql`) and automatically serves the GUI to web browsers.  When `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, GraphQL Playground (as well as introspection) is disabled as a production best-practice.

## Configuring Playground

The Apollo Server constructor contains the ability to configure GraphQL Playground with the `playground` configuration option. The options can be found on GraphQL Playground's [documentation](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground/#usage).

```js
new ApolloServer({
typeDefs,
resolvers,
playground: {
  settings: {
    'editor.theme': 'light',
  },
  tabs: [
    {
      endpoint,
      query: defaultQuery,
    },
  ],
},
});
```

## Enabling GraphQL Playground in production

To enable GraphQL Playground in production, introspection and the playground can be enabled explicitly in the following manner.

```js{7-8}
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: true,
  playground: true,
});


server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```
