<ExpansionPanel title="ðŸ“£ The Apollo Studio Explorer now supports local development">

Apollo Studio now supports **dev graphs**, which are user-specific graphs that represent your local development server. Dev graphs enable you to query your locally running server with Studio's powerful Explorer.

To try out dev graphs:

1. Make sure your server is running locally.
2. Visit [studio.apollographql.com/dev](https://studio.apollographql.com/dev).
3. Create a (free) Apollo account if you don't have one. Then specify a name, endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`), and organization for your dev graph.
4. Try running operations on your local server using the [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/).

[GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) is a graphical, interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE, created by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and based on [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

In development, Apollo Server enables GraphQL Playground on the same URL as the GraphQL server itself (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/graphql`) and automatically serves the GUI to web browsers.  When `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, GraphQL Playground (as well as introspection) is disabled as a production best-practice. It does this by installing the `ApolloServerPluginFrontendGraphQLPlayground` plugin with default settings.

## Configuring Playground

If you'd like to configure playground, you can add `ApolloServerPluginFrontendGraphQLPlayground` to your Apollo Server yourself. The options can be found on GraphQL Playground's [documentation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/#usage).

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloServerPluginFrontendGraphQLPlayground } = require('apollo-server-core');

new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginFrontendGraphQLPlayground({
      settings: {
        'editor.theme': 'light',
      },
      tabs: [
        {
          endpoint,
          query: defaultQuery,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Disabling Playground in development

If you don't want to run GraphQL Playground at all, you have two choices. First, you can replace it with a different frontend by installing a plugin that implements the [`renderFrontend` hook](../integrations/plugins/#renderfrontend). Alternatively, you can install the `ApolloServerPluginFrontendDisabled` plugin which stops Apollo Server from serving any HTML frontend.

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloServerPluginFrontendDisabled } = require('apollo-server-core');

new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [ApolloServerPluginFrontendDisabled()],
});
```

## Enabling GraphQL Playground in production

To enable GraphQL Playground in production, just install GraphQL Playground yourself, without any special configuration. You should also enable introspection so that GraphQL Playground can load your graph's schema.

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloServerPluginFrontendGraphQLPlayground } = require('apollo-server-core');

new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: true,
  plugins: [ApolloServerPluginFrontendGraphQLPlayground()],
});

```
