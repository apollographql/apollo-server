**Apollo Sandbox** is a special instance of the Apollo Studio Explorer that you can use for local development without an Apollo account.

<p>
  <Button
    size="large"
    color={colors.primary}
    as={<Link to="https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/" target="_blank" />}
  >
    Launch Sandbox
  </Button>
</p>

Sandbox automatically attempts to connect to a GraphQL server running at `http://localhost:4000`. You can use the box at the top of the page to change this URL to any local or remote GraphQL endpoint that's accessible by your browser.

[GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) is a graphical, interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE, created by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and based on [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

(Note: This whole page needs to be updated for AS3 now that Playground is not the default.)

In development, Apollo Server enables GraphQL Playground on the same URL as the GraphQL server itself (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/graphql`) and automatically serves the GUI to web browsers.  When `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, GraphQL Playground (as well as introspection) is disabled as a production best-practice. It does this by installing the `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` plugin with default settings.

## Configuring Playground

If you'd like to configure playground, you can add `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` to your Apollo Server yourself. The options can be found on GraphQL Playground's [documentation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/#usage).

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } = require('apollo-server-core');

new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({
      settings: {
        'editor.theme': 'light',
      },
      tabs: [
        {
          endpoint,
          query: defaultQuery,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Disabling Playground in development

If you don't want to run GraphQL Playground at all, you have two choices. First, you can replace it with a different landing page by installing a plugin that implements the [`renderLandingPage` hook](../integrations/plugins/#renderlandingpage). Alternatively, you can install the `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled` plugin which stops Apollo Server from serving any HTML landing page.

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled } = require('apollo-server-core');

new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled()],
});
```

## Enabling GraphQL Playground in production

To enable GraphQL Playground in production, just install GraphQL Playground yourself, without any special configuration. You should also enable introspection so that GraphQL Playground can load your graph's schema.

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } = require('apollo-server-core');

new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: true,
  plugins: [ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground()],
});

```
