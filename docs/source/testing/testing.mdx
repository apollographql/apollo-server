Apollo Server uses a [multi-step request pipeline](../integrations/plugins/#request-lifecycle-event-flow) to validate and execute incoming GraphQL operations. This pipeline supports integration with custom plugins at each step, which can affect an operation's execution. Because of this, it's important to perform **integration tests** with a variety of operations to ensure your request pipeline works as expected.

There are two main options for integration testing with Apollo Server:
* Using `ApolloServer`'s `executeOperation` method.
* Setting up an HTTP client to query your server.

## Testing using `executeOperation`

Apollo Server's `executeOperation` method enables you to run operations through the request pipeline _without_ sending an HTTP request.

The [`executeOperation` method](../api/apollo-server/#executeoperation) accepts the following arguments:
* An object that describes the GraphQL operation to execute.
  * This object must include a `query` field specifying the GraphQL operation to run. You can use `executeOperation` to execute both queries and mutations, but both use the `query` field.
* An optional argument that is passed in to the `ApolloServer` instance's [`context` function](../data/resolvers/#the-context-argument).

Below is a simplified example of setting up a test using the JavaScript testing library [Jest](https://jestjs.io/):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.test.ts"
// For clarity in this example we included our typeDefs and resolvers above our test,
// but in a real world situation you'd be importing these in from different files
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello(name: String): String!
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (_, { name }) => `Hello ${name}!`,
  },
};

it('returns hello with the provided name', async () => {
  const testServer = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers
  });

  const result = await testServer.executeOperation({
    query: 'query SayHelloWorld($name: String) { hello(name: $name) }',
    variables: { name: 'world' },
  });

  expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
  expect(result.data?.hello).toBe('Hello world!');
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Note that when testing, any errors in parsing, validating, and executing your GraphQL operation are returned in the `errors` field of the operation result. As with any GraphQL response, these errors are not _thrown_.

Unlike with a normal instance of `ApolloServer`,  you don't need to call [`start`](../api/apollo-server/#start) before calling `executeOperation`. The server instance calls `start` automatically for you if it hasn't been called already, and any startup errors are thrown.

To expand on the example above, here's a full integration test being run against a test instance of `ApolloServer`. This test imports all of the important pieces to test (`typeDefs`, `resolvers`, `dataSources`) and creates a new instance of `ApolloServer`.

```js title="integration.test.js"
it('fetches single launch', async () => {
  const userAPI = new UserAPI({ store });
  const launchAPI = new LaunchAPI();

  // create a test server to test against, using our production typeDefs,
  // resolvers, and dataSources.
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    dataSources: () => ({ userAPI, launchAPI }),
    context: () => ({ user: { id: 1, email: 'a@a.a' } }),
  });

  // mock the dataSource's underlying fetch methods
  launchAPI.get = jest.fn(() => [mockLaunchResponse]);
  userAPI.store = mockStore;
  userAPI.store.trips.findAll.mockReturnValueOnce([
    { dataValues: { launchId: 1 } },
  ]);

  // run the query against the server and snapshot the output
  const res = await server.executeOperation({ query: GET_LAUNCH, variables: { id: 1 } });
  expect(res).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

The example above includes a test-specific [`context` function](../data/resolvers/#the-context-argument), which provides data directly to the `ApolloServer` instance instead of calculating it from the request's context.

To use your server's defined `context` function, you can pass a second argument to `executeOperation`, which is then passed to your server's `context` function. Note that to use your server's `context` function you need to put together an object with the correct [middleware-specific context fields](../api/apollo-server/#middleware-specific-context-fields) for your implementation.

>For examples of both integration and end-to-end testing we recommend checking out the [tests included in the Apollo fullstack tutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial/tree/master/final/server/src/__tests__).

## End-to-end testing

Instead of bypassing the HTTP layer, you might want to fully run your server and test it with a real HTTP client. Apollo Server doesn't provide built-in support for this at this time.

You can run operations against your server using a combination of any HTTP or GraphQL client such as [`supertest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) or [Apollo Client's HTTP Link](/react/api/link/apollo-link-http/) . There are also community packages available such as [`apollo-server-integration-testing`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-integration-testing), which uses mocked Express request and response objects.

Below is an example of writing an end-to-end test using the `apollo-server` package and `supertest`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="server.test.ts"
/// we import a function that we wrote to create a new instance of Apollo Server
import { createApolloServer } from '../server';

// we will use supertest to test our server
import request from 'supertest';

// this is the query we use for our test
const queryData = {
  query: `query sayHello($name: String) {
    hello(name: $name)
  }`,
  variables: { name: 'world' },
};

describe('e2e demo', () => {
  let server, url;

  // before the tests we will spin up a new Apollo Server
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Note we must wrap our object destructuring in parentheses because we already declared these variables
    // We pass in the port as 0 to let the server pick its own ephemeral port for testing
    ({ server, url } = await createApolloServer({ port: 0 }));
  });

  // after the tests we will stop our server
  afterAll(async () => {
    await server?.close();
  });

  it('says hello', async () => {
    // send our request to the url of the test server
    const response = await request(url).post('/').send(queryData);
    expect(response.errors).toBeUndefined();
    expect(response.body.data?.hello).toBe('Hello world!');
  });
});
```
