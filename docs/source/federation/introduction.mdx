title: Apollo Federation overview
description: Implement a single data graph across multiple services
---

To get the most out of GraphQL, your organization should expose a [single data
graph](https://principledgraphql.com/integrity#1-one-graph) that provides a
unified interface for querying all of your backing data sources. This
allows clients to fetch data from any number of sources simultaneously,
_without_ needing to know which data comes from which source.

As your data graph grows, however, it can become inefficient or even difficult
to represent the graph with a single, monolithic GraphQL server. To remedy this,
you can divide your data graph's implementation across distinct, composable
services with **Apollo Federation**.

Unlike other distributed GraphQL
architectures (such as schema stitching), Apollo Federation uses a declarative
programming model that makes it easy for each **implementing service** to
implement _only_ the part of your data graph that it should be responsible for.
This way, your organization can represent an enterprise-scale data graph as a
collection of separately maintained GraphQL services.

## Incremental adoption

Like the rest of the Apollo platform, Apollo Federation can (and should) be
adopted **incrementally**:

* If you currently use a monolithic GraphQL server, you can break its functionality out one service at a time.
* If you currently use a different _distributed_ data graph strategy (such as schema stitching), you can [add federation support to your existing implementing services one at a time](/federation/migrating-from-stitching/).

In both of these cases, all of your clients will continue to work throughout
your incremental migration. In fact, clients have no way to distinguish between
different data graph implementations.

## Apollo Server implementation

Apollo Server supports Apollo Federation via two open-source extensions:
`@apollo/federation` and `@apollo/gateway`.

* `@apollo/federation` provides primitives that your implementing services use to make their individual GraphQL schemas composable.
* `@apollo/gateway` enables you to set up an instance of Apollo Server as a **gateway** that distributes incoming GraphQL operations across one or more  implementing services.

## Federated schema example

Let's look at an example. Below, we define the schema for a basic e-commerce
application as three _federated_ schemas, each of which can be implemented as
a standalone GraphQL service:

```graphql:title=accounts
extend type Query {
  me: User
}

type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
}
```

```graphql:title=products
extend type Query {
  topProducts(first: Int = 5): [Product]
}

type Product @key(fields: "upc") {
  upc: String!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql:title=reviews
type Review {
  body: String
  author: User @provides(fields: "username")
  product: Product
}

extend type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  reviews: [Review]
}

extend type Product @key(fields: "upc") {
  upc: String! @external
  reviews: [Review]
}
```

These schemas illustrate several important conventions of Apollo Federation:

* An implementing service can reference a type that's defined by
_another_ implementing service. For example, the `Review` type includes a
`product` field of type `Product`, even though the `Product` type is defined in
a different service.

* An implementing service can also _extend_ a type that's defined by another
implementing service. For example, the `reviews` service extends the `User`
type by adding a `reviews` field to it.

* An implementing service must add the `@key` directive to a type's definition
in order for _other_ services to be able to reference or extend that type. This
directive tells other services which fields to use to uniquely identify a
particular instance of the type.

## Gateway example

The gateway for our federated data graph fetches the schema from each
implementing service and composes those schemas into a single graph:

```js
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'accounts', url: 'http://localhost:4001' },
    { name: 'products', url: 'http://localhost:4002' },
    { name: 'reviews', url: 'http://localhost:4003' }
  ]
});

const server = new ApolloServer({ gateway });
server.listen();
```

Thatâ€™s it! With Apollo Federation, schemas and resolvers live in your
implementing services. The gateway serves only to plan and execute GraphQL
operations across those implementing services.

## Query examples

Now we can execute GraphQL operations against our composed schema just as if it
were implemented as a monolithic service:

```graphql
# a query that the gateway can resolve by calling only the products service
query {
  topProducts {
    upc
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql
# a query that the gateway must call all three services to fully resolve
query {
  me {
    username
    reviews {
      body
      product {
        name
        upc
      }
    }
  }
}
```
