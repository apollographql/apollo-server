title: Implementing a federated graph
description: Putting the pieces together
---
Apollo Federation is made up of two parts:
* Federated services, which are standalone parts of the graph
* A gateway which composes the overall schema and executes federated queries

To be part of a federated graph, a microservice implements the Apollo Federation spec which exposes its capabilities to tooling and the gateway. The federated service can extend types from other services and add its own types that can be extended.

Collectively, federated services form a composed graph. This composition is done by a gateway which knows how to take an incoming operation and turn it into a plan of fetches to downstream services. The gateway orchestrates requests, merges the data and errors together, and forms the overall result to send back to the client.

Let's take a look at how to get a federated graph up and running. We'll start by preparing an existing service for federation, followed by setting up a gateway in front of it.

## Defining a federated service

Converting an existing schema into a federated service is the first step in building a federated graph. To do this, we'll use the `buildFederatedSchema()` function from the `@apollo/federation` package.

Let's start with a basic Apollo Server and make the switch:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

If you're already familiar with [setting up an Apollo Server](/getting-started/), this should look pretty familiar. If not, we recommend you first take a moment to get comfortable with this topic before jumping in to federation.

Now, let's see what this looks like as a federated service:

First step is to install the `@apollo/federation` package into the project:

```sh
npm install @apollo/federation
```

Then just define the entity's key, implement its reference resolver, and call `buildFederatedSchema`:
```javascript{2,9,21-25,29}
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { buildFederatedSchema } = require('@apollo/federation');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }){
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildFederatedSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }])
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```
> Note: we're now providing a `schema` to the `ApolloServer` constructor, rather than `typeDefs` and `resolvers`.

Now the service is running as a federated service and is ready to be composed into an overall federated graph!

## Running a gateway

Now that we have a federation-ready service, we can get started with building our gateway. First let's install the gateway package and Apollo Server:

```sh
npm install @apollo/gateway apollo-server graphql
```

Now we can create a new service that acts as a gateway to the underlying microservices:

```javascript{2,4-9,11}
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway } = require("@apollo/gateway");

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'accounts', url: 'http://localhost:4001' },
    // more services
  ],
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,

  // Currently, subscriptions are enabled by default with Apollo Server, however,
  // subscriptions are not compatible with the gateway.  We hope to resolve this
  // limitation in future versions of Apollo Server.  Please reach out to us on
  // https://spectrum.chat/apollo/apollo-server if this is critical to your adoption!
  subscriptions: false,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

In this example, we provide the `serviceList` configuration to the `ApolloGateway` constructor, which provides a `name` and endpoint (i.e. `url`) for each of the federated services. The name (an arbitrary string) is primarily used for query planner output, error messages, and logging.

Due the power and flexibility of federation's `_entities` field **federated services should not be publicly accessible**.  Clients are expected to communicate directly with the gateway.  Since circumventing this pattern could expose downstream federated services in ways which they were not intended to be exposed, proper ingress limitations (e.g. firewall rules) should be enforced.

> NOTE: In production, we recommend configuring the gateway in a managed mode, which relies on static files rather than introspection. For details on how to use the [Apollo schema registry](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/schema-registry/) to support this workflow, see [the platform docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/federation/).

On startup, the gateway will fetch the service capabilities from the running servers and form an overall composed graph. It will accept incoming requests and create query plans which query the underlying services in the service list.

> If there are any composition errors, the `new ApolloServer` call will throw with a list of [validation errors](/federation/errors/).

## Sharing context across services

For existing services, it's likely that you've already implemented some form of authentication to convert a request into a user, or require some information passed to the service through request headers. `@apollo/gateway` makes it easy to reuse the context feature of Apollo Server to customize what information is sent to underlying services. Let's see what it looks like to pass user information along from the gateway to its services:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway, RemoteGraphQLDataSource } = require('@apollo/gateway');

// highlight-start
class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
    // pass the user's id from the context to underlying services
    // as a header called `user-id`
    request.http.headers.set('user-id', context.userId);
  }
}
// highlight-end

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'products', url: 'http://localhost:4001' },
    // other services
  ],
  // highlight-start
  buildService({ name, url }) {
    return new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
  },
  // highlight-end
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
  subscriptions: false, // Must be disabled with the gateway; see above.
  context: ({ req }) => {
    // get the user token from the headers
    const token = req.headers.authorization || '';

    // try to retrieve a user with the token
    const userId = getUserId(token);

    // add the user to the context
    return { userId };
  },
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

By leveraging the `buildService` function, we're able to customize how requests are sent to our federated services. In this example, we return a custom `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`. The datasource allows us to modify the outgoing request with information from the Apollo Server `context` before it's sent. Here, we're adding the `user-id` header to pass an authenticated user id to downstream services.

In a similar vein, the `didReceiveResponse` hook allows us to inspect a service's `response` in order to modify the `context`. The lifecycle of a request to a federated server involves a number of responses, which may contain headers that need to be passed back to the client. Suppose our services report back their id via a `Server-Id` header.

![Flowchart demonstrating willSendResponse usage](../images/willSendResponse-flowchart.png)

To implement this, we can aggregate the server IDs into a single, comma-separated list in our final response using the `didReceiveResponse` hook and an `ApolloServerPlugin`:
```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway, RemoteGraphQLDataSource } = require('@apollo/gateway');

class DataSourceWithServerId extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  // highlight-start
  async didReceiveResponse(response, request, context) {
    const body = await super.didReceiveResponse(response, request, context);
    // Parse the Server-Id header and add it to the array on context
    const serverId = response.headers.get('Server-Id');
    if (serverId) {
      context.serverIds.push(serverId);
    }
    return body;
  }
  // highlight-end
}

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'products', url: 'http://localhost:4001' }
    // other services
  ],
  // highlight-start
  buildService({ url }) {
    return new DataSourceWithCacheControl({ url });
  }
  // highlight-end
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
  subscriptions: false, // Must be disabled with the gateway; see above.
  context() {
    return { serverIds: [] };
  },
  plugins: [
    // highlight-start
    {
      requestDidStart() {
        return {
          willSendResponse({ context, response }) {
            // Append our final result to the outgoing response headers
            response.http.headers.append(
              'Server-Id',
              context.serverIds.join(',')
            );
          }
        };
      }
    }
    // highlight-end
  ]
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```
