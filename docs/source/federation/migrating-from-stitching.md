title: Migrating from schema stitching
description: How to move your services to Apollo Federation
---

If you have a distributed data graph that uses schema stitching, follow the
steps in this guide to migrate it to use Apollo Federation.

For details on the advantages of using a federated data graph instead of
schema stitching, see [this blog post](https://blog.apollographql.com/apollo-federation-f260cf525d21).

## Summary of steps

You can (and should) migrate **incrementally** from schema stitching to Apollo Federation.
To do so, you run an Apollo Server gateway _alongside_ your existing schema-stitching gateway and migrate the services that implement your data graph (**implementing services**)
one at a time.

Here are the high-level steps for migrating to Apollo Federation:

1. Add federation support to your implementing services
2. Register your GraphQL schemas with a registry
3. Start up an instance of Apollo Server as a gateway
4. Migrate stitching logic from your schema-stitching gateway to your implementing services
5. Move traffic from the schema-stitching gateway to the Apollo Server gateway
6. Remove schema-stitching fields from your federated schema and complete your migration

Each step is described in detail below.

## Step 1: Add federation support to your implementing services

You can add federation support to your implementing services _without_ impacting your
existing schema-stitching architecture. Support for federation is fully compatible
with schema stitching.

Because of this, we recommend that you migrate your implementing services in place
instead of creating replacement services. Doing so helps you identify any type conflicts that exist across your data graph.

### Using Apollo Server

If your implementing services use Apollo Server, add federation
support to them by installing the `@apollo/federation` package:

```bash
npm install @apollo/federation
```

Then use the `buildFederatedSchema` function to augment your schema with
fields that are necessary for federation support:

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { buildFederatedSchema } = require('@apollo/federation');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildFederatedSchema([
    {
      typeDefs,
      resolvers,
    },
  ]),
});
```

### Using a GraphQL server besides Apollo Server

There are several community-contributed packages that add federation support to other GraphQL runtimes. These include:

* [GraphQL-Java](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-jvm)
* [Graphene](https://pypi.org/project/graphene-federation/)
* [GraphQL-Ruby](https://github.com/Gusto/apollo-federation-ruby)

If you're using one of these packages, ensure that after configuring it, your existing schema-stitching gateway continues to work correctly.

## Step 2: Register your schemas with a GraphQL registry

We strongly recommend that you register all of your GraphQL schemas with an [external registry](https://principledgraphql.com/integrity#3-track-the-schema-in-a-registry). Doing so improves the reliability of your data graph and maintains a single source of truth to simplify collaboration.

[Apollo Graph Manager](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/) provides a free schema registry that helps you manage your federated gateway's configuration. You provide your gateway a Graph Manager API key on startup, which directs the gateway to download your schemas automatically in a fault-tolerant way.

Graph Manager can also provide [schema validation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/federation/#validating-changes-to-the-graph) to ensure that all
changes you
make to your implementing services are compatible with your complete data graph.

## Step 3: Start up an Apollo Server gateway

After you've registered your schemas, you can start exposing your implementing services from a federation-compatible gateway. Apollo Server's gateway is a query planner and executor that handles incoming GraphQL requests and breaks them down into a collection of operations to perform on your implementing services.

We recommend setting up the Apollo Server gateway _alongside_ your existing schema-stitching gateway. Depending on your infrastructure, you might even want to run both in the same _process_ to support dynamically routing traffic through one gateway or the other.

To enable managed configuration through Apollo Graph Manager, set the `ENGINE_API_KEY` and `ENGINE_SCHEMA_TAG` environment variables when you start up your Apollo Server gateway, and **do not provide the `serviceList` constructor option to `ApolloGateway`**. For details, see the [Graph Manager documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/federation/#connecting-apollo-server-to-the-graph-manager).

After your gateway is set up, you can make direct queries to it that are routed to the correct implementing services.

## Step 4: Move linking logic to your implementing services

When using a schema-stitching gateway, your linking logic typically resides _in the gateway itself_. In the federation model, however, linking logic resides _in each implementing service_. Therefore, you need to migrate linking logic from your schema-stitching gateway into each of your implementing services.

Here are recommendations for common cases when migrating your logic:

* **Fragments**: Fragments in a schema-stitching resolver, usually translate to a combination of `@key` and `@requires` directives in a federated model. In general, think of `@key` as the field(s) that completely identify an entity, and only use `@requires` for additional, non-identifying information.
* **Filtering types**: We do not recommend filtering types out of your exposed schema when using a gateway. If you want to hide types, do not include them in your service's registered schema.
* **Renaming types**: If you are currently renaming types at the gateway level,  rename these types at the service level instead.
* **Transforming fields**: If you are currently transforming fields at the gateway level, transform these fields at the service level instead.

### Adding resolvers to your federated services

At this point your implementing services support federation, but they still need
to be able to resolve extensions to types that are defined in _other_ services.

A schema-stitching architecture declares this logic at the gateway level using the
`delegateToSchema` function, like so:

```js
resolvers: {
  Reservation: {
    user: {
      fragment: `... on Reservation { userId }`,
      resolve: (parent, args, context, info) => {
        return info.mergeInfo.delegateToSchema({
          schema: userSchema,
          operation: 'query',
          fieldName: 'user',
          args: {
            id: parent.userId,
          },
          context,
          info,
        });
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This resolver calls `Query.user` on the `userSchema` to look up a `User`. It adds that user to the `Reservation.user` field that was previously defined at the gateway. This code can all remain. You don't need to remove it from the stitched gateway. In fact, if you did that, the stitched gateway would break.

On the other hand, a _federated_ architecture defines its resolvers at the service level. These
resolvers rely on **entities**, which are identified by a primary key. For example, the Reservation
service must define the `Reservation` type as an entity to allow other services
to extend it. These other services use the `Reservation`'s `@key` fields to uniquely
identify a given instance:

```graphql
type Reservation @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  ...
}
```

In the Users service, you can then extend the `Reservation` type with a `user` field like so:

```graphql
extend type Reservation @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  userId: ID! @external
  user: User @requires(fields: "userId")
}
```

The `user` field indicates that it `@requires` a `Reservation`'s `userId` field in order to identify the user that _made_ the reservation.

Then in the Users service, you can add a resolver for `Reservation.user` like so:

```js
{
  Reservation: {
    user: ({ userId }) => {
      return lookupUser(userId);
    },
  }
}
```

Federated resolvers like this one always receive an object that represents an instance of the extended entity. This object includes the fields that are part of
the entity's `@key`, along with any other fields that the resolver `@requires`.

For example, this `Reservation.user` resolver receives the `id` of the reservation and a `userId`. You can use the `userId` to look up the corresponding user.

## Step 5: Move traffic from the schema-stitching gateway to the Apollo Server gateway

At this point, both your schema-stitching gateway and your federated gateway are able to resolve GraphQL operations. You can now begin moving traffic from the schema-stitching gateway to the federated gateway.

Perform this migration in the manner that best suits your infrastructure and applications.

Some options include:

* Testing a complete migration in your staging environment to verify that both gateways behave identically
* Use HTTP headers or feature flags to migrate your internal clients without affecting your user-facing clients

## Step 6: Remove schema-stitching fields from your federated schema

After you've fully migrated your graph and incoming traffic to use your federated gateway, you can remove all stitching-specific logic from your architecture.

You can now begin to modify your existing schema to take full advantage of the
features that federation provides. These features include:

* Greater flexibility with [federation core concepts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/core-concepts/)
