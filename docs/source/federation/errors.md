title: Understanding errors
description: Rules for schema composition
---
Apollo Federation implements a strict composition model. When building a gateway using the `@apollo/gateway` package, `ApolloServer` validates that the provided services compose into a valid GraphQL schema **and** that the gateway has all of the information it needs to execute operations against the composed schema. Any errors will fail composition. This section documents the composition errors that can be thrown by the `new ApolloServer()` call.

### Types and extensions

- `EXTENSION_OF_WRONG_KIND`: An extension is attempting to extend a different type. For example, an interface extension, `extend interface MyType`, would be invalid for a type definition such as `type MyType`.
- `EXTENSION_WITH_NO_BASE`: An extension is attempting to extend a type which does not exist.

### `@key` directives

- `KEY_FIELDS_SELECT_INVALID_TYPE`: The fields argument can not have root fields that result in a list, interface, or union type.
- `KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_ON_BASE`: the fields argument can not select fields that were overwritten by another service.
- `KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_EXTERNAL`: On extended types, keys must reference a field marked as `@external`.

### `@external` directives

- `EXTERNAL_UNUSED`: For every `@external` field, there should be at least one `@requires`, `@provides`, or `@key` directive that references it.
- `EXTERNAL_TYPE_MISMATCH`: All fields marked with `@external` must match the type definition of the base service.
- `EXTERNAL_MISSING_ON_BASE`: All fields marked with `@external` must exist on the base type.
- `EXTERNAL_USED_ON_BASE`: There should be no fields with `@external` on base type definitions.

### `@provides` directives

- `PROVIDES_FIELDS_MISSING_EXTERNAL`: The fields argument can only use fields marked as `@external` on types from external services. These external types and fields must be included in the service for validation.
- `PROVIDES_NOT_ON_ENTITY`: The `@provides` directive can only be used on Object types with at least one @key, or Lists of such Objects.
- `PROVIDES_FIELDS_SELECT_INVALID_TYPE`: The fields argument can not reference fields that result in a list or interface.

### `@requires` directives

- `REQUIRES_FIELDS_MISSING_EXTERNAL`: For every field in a `@requires` selection, there must be a matching `@external` field in the service.
- `REQUIRES_FIELDS_MISSING_ON_BASE`: The fields arg in `@requires` can only reference fields on the base type.
- `REQUIRES_USED_ON_BASE`: The requires directive may not be used on fields defined on a base type.

### Enums and Scalars

- `DUPLICATE_ENUM_DEFINITION`: An Enum was defined multiple times in a single service. Remove one of the definitions.
- `DUPLICATE_SCALAR_DEFINITION`: A Scalar was defined multiple times in a single service. Remove one of the definitions.
- `DUPLICATE_ENUM_VALUE`: A service has multiple definitions of the same Enum `value`. This duplicate value may be in the definition itself or enum extensions.
- `ENUM_MISMATCH`: An Enum does not have identical values across all services. Even if a service does not use all enum values, they still must be provided if another service uses them. This error will list services with matching definitions like `[serviceA, serviceB], [serviceC]` where `serviceA` and `serviceB` have matching enum definitions, and `serviceC` does not match the other definitions.
- `ENUM_MISMATCH_TYPE`: Enums must not use the name of a type in another service. For example, if a service defines an enum of `Category`, all definitions of `Category` in other services must also be enums.

### Root Fields

- `RESERVED_FIELD_USED`: The `Query._service` and `Query._entities` fields are reserved, and should not be manually defined by any service.
- `ROOT_QUERY_USED`: `Query` is disallowed when a schema definition or extension is provided.
- `ROOT_MUTATION_USED`: `Mutation` is disallowed when a schema definition or extension is provided.
- `ROOT_SUBSCRIPTION_USED`: `Subscription` is disallowed when a schema definition or extension is provided.

### Value Types

- `VALUE_TYPE_FIELD_TYPE_MISMATCH`: Two identical types were found, however one or more of their field's types aren't the same. Value types must be identical across services.
- `VALUE_TYPE_NO_ENTITY`: Two identical types were found, however it's marked as an entity in one of the services. Extend the type correctly, or make the identical types non-entities.
- `VALUE_TYPE_UNION_TYPES_MISMATCH`: Two identical union types were found, however their types are not the same. Shared union types must be identical across services.
- `VALUE_TYPE_KIND_MISMATCH`: A type was found with the same name and fields, however they aren't of the same kind (object, input, interface). Only value types can be duplicated across services.

### Modified SDL validations

- Unique Type Names: type definitions can not be duplicated across services, with the exception of Enums, Scalars, and [value types](/federation/core-concepts/#value-types). This is a modified version of the `graphql-js` validation with exclusions for Enums and Scalars, since those are required to be duplicated across services.
