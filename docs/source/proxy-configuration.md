title: Proxy configuration
description: Configuring proxy settings for outgoing requests
---

Certain features of the Apollo platform require Apollo Server to make outgoing requests to Apollo Studio.  These include:

* Managed federation
* Operation registry

Depending on security policies, you might need to configure an outgoing HTTP proxy in order to allow these requests.

While Apollo Server supports standard Node.js "agent" configuration via [`https.globalAgent`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_globalagent) and [`http.globalAgent`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_globalagent) directly, we recommend using the [`global-agent`](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#global-agent) package to reduce the amount of necessary configuration involved with [creating a custom agent](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent).

The `global-agent` package allows support for the common technique of setting proxy settings using environment variables (e.g. `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_AGENT`, etc.), which is not supported by Node.js itself (and [may never be](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/15620)).

## Configuring the proxy agent

This guide covers the `global-agent` package which is supported by Node.js versions v10 and higher.  When using Node.js versions _prior_ to v10, consider using the [`global-tunnel-ng`](https://github.com/np-maintain/global-tunnel) which behaves similarly, but is configured differently.

### Installing the `global-agent` dependency

First, install the `global-agent` package with your dependency manager:

```
npm install global-agent
```

### Bootstrapping the `global-agent` proxy agent

After the `global-agent` dependency has been installed, invoke its `bootstrap` method **before** Apollo Server is initialized:

```js{2-5})
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { bootstrap: bootstrapGlobalAgent } = require('global-agent');

// Setup global support for environment variable based proxy configuration.
bootstrapGlobalAgent();

// The following represents existing configuration, though its
// important to bootstrap the agent before Apollo Server.
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typesDefs,
  resolvers,
});
```

### Configuring the proxy using environment variables

Depending on the deployment environment (e.g. AWS, Heroku, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.), environment variables may be set differently.  These instructions will demonstrate how to start a `node` process using environment variables in a Unix-based shell.

By default, the above bootstrapping step will enable the following environment variables:

* `GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY`

  This is often the most important and solely necessary environment variable to set.

* `GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTPS_PROXY`

  This variable defines where HTTPS traffic (i.e. encrypted SSL/TLS traffic) is proxied.  If this is not set, HTTPS traffic will route through the HTTP proxy.

* `GLOBAL_AGENT_NO_PROXY`

  This variable allows the exclusion of certain domains from being proxied.

By setting these environment variables, it is possible to configure `global-agent`'s creation of the agent that is used for outgoing requests.  If the proxy requires special certificates for SSL/TLS requests, read the details later in this page.

Using the appropriate environment variables, define them when starting the server.  For example, to send all outgoing requests from a Node.js server through `http://proxy:3128`, the configuration would be:

```shell
$ GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:3128/ node index.js
```

The `GLOBAL_AGENT_NO_PROXY` environment variable can also be defined to exclude certain URLs from being proxied:

```shell
$ GLOBAL_AGENT_NO_PROXY='*.foo.com,10.0.1.100,baz.com' node index.js
```

> For more information, see [Exclude URLs](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#exclude-urls) in the `global-agent` documentation.

As shown above, the [supported environment variables](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#environment-variables) are all prefixed with `GLOBAL_AGENT_` to avoid undesirable by-products](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#what-is-the-reason-global-agentbootstrap-does-not-use-http_proxy) of using the more common non-prefixed versions (e.g. `HTTP_PROXY`).  To disable this default namespacing (i.e. prefixing), the server can be started with `GLOBAL_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAMESPACE` set to an empty string:

```shell
$ GLOBAL_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAMESPACE="" HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:3128/ node index.js
```

Of course, a custom namespace can also be provided as well.  For more details on the configuration, see [the documentation for `global-agent`](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#global-agent).

## Specifying a custom SSL/TLS certificate

Depending on the proxy communication, it may be necessary to extend the default "root" certificates which Node.js trusts to include a certificate provided by the proxy administrator.  These certificates will usually allow the proxy to handle SSL/TLS traffic and permits the proxy to analyze such traffic.

This can be done [via Node.js' `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file):

1. The appropriate certificate (i.e. PEM file) must be present on the file-system where the server is running.
2. Start the server with the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable set to that path, combined with the existing proxy configuration variables which were explained above:

   ```shell
   $ NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/full/path/to/certificate.pem \
       GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:3128/ \
       node index.js
   ```
