description: Enabling file uploads in Apollo Server
---

There are a few ways to accomplish file uploads in Apollo Server. Our [blog post](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/backend/file-uploads/file-upload-best-practices/) on file uploads goes in depth on the approaches we've taken, outlining the pros and cons of each.

Apollo recommends handling the file upload itself out-of-band of your GraphQL server for the sake of simplicity and security. This "signed URL" approach allows your client to retrieve a URL from your GraphQL server (via S3 or other storage service) and upload the file to the URL rather than to your GraphQL server. The blog post mentioned above goes into detail on how to set this up.

Another common approach involves adding file upload support directly to Apollo Server via the third-party [`graphql-upload`](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) library. This package provides support for the `multipart/form-data` content-type. **Note: this approach is vulnerable to a [CSRF mutation attack](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-2p3c-p3qw-69r4) unless Apollo Server is explicitly configured with `csrfPrevention: true`.** In the examples below, we demonstrate configuring CSRF prevention in order to prevent this vulnerability by always requiring a "preflight" OPTIONS request before executing an operation. When configuring your file upload client, you will need to send a non-empty `Apollo-Require-Preflight` header or Apollo Server will block the request. For example, if you use the `apollo-upload-client` package with Apollo Client Web, pass headers: `{'Apollo-Require-Preflight': 'true'}` to `createUploadLink`.

**New in Apollo Server 3:** Apollo Server 3 does not contain a built-in integration with `graphql-upload` like in Apollo Server 2. Instead, the instructions below show how to integrate it yourself. You cannot do this with the "batteries-included" `apollo-server` library; you must use a web framework integration such as `apollo-server-express` instead. This page shows how to integrate `graphql-upload` with Express and Fastify. To implement similar functionality with another Node.js HTTP framework (e.g., Koa), see the [`graphql-upload` documentation](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) for more information. Some integrations might need to use `graphql-upload`'s `processRequest` directly.

### Integrating with Express

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');
const {
  GraphQLUpload,
  graphqlUploadExpress, // A Koa implementation is also exported.
} = require('graphql-upload');
const { finished } = require('stream/promises');
const {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault,
} = require('apollo-server-core');

const typeDefs = gql`
  # The implementation for this scalar is provided by the
  # 'GraphQLUpload' export from the 'graphql-upload' package
  # in the resolver map below.
  scalar Upload

  type File {
    filename: String!
    mimetype: String!
    encoding: String!
  }

  type Query {
    # This is only here to satisfy the requirement that at least one
    # field be present within the 'Query' type.  This example does not
    # demonstrate how to fetch uploads back.
    otherFields: Boolean!
  }

  type Mutation {
    # Multiple uploads are supported. See graphql-upload docs for details.
    singleUpload(file: Upload!): File!
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  // This maps the `Upload` scalar to the implementation provided
  // by the `graphql-upload` package.
  Upload: GraphQLUpload,

  Mutation: {
    singleUpload: async (parent, { file }) => {
      const { createReadStream, filename, mimetype, encoding } = await file;

      // Invoking the `createReadStream` will return a Readable Stream.
      // See https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams
      const stream = createReadStream();

      // This is purely for demonstration purposes and will overwrite the
      // local-file-output.txt in the current working directory on EACH upload.
      const out = require('fs').createWriteStream('local-file-output.txt');
      stream.pipe(out);
      await finished(out);

      return { filename, mimetype, encoding };
    },
  },
};

async function startServer() {
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    // Using graphql-upload without CSRF prevention is very insecure.
    csrfPrevention: true,
    cache: 'bounded',
    plugins: [
      ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
    ],
  });
  await server.start();

  const app = express();

  // This middleware should be added before calling `applyMiddleware`.
  app.use(graphqlUploadExpress());

  server.applyMiddleware({ app });

  await new Promise<void>(r => app.listen({ port: 4000 }, r));

  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`);
}

startServer();
```

### Integrating with Fastify

```js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-fastify');
const {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault,
} = require('apollo-server-core');
const { GraphQLUpload, processRequest } = require('graphql-upload');
const { finished } = require('stream/promises');

const typeDefs = gql`
  # The implementation for this scalar is provided by the
  # 'GraphQLUpload' export from the 'graphql-upload' package
  # in the resolver map below.
  scalar Upload

  type File {
    filename: String!
    mimetype: String!
    encoding: String!
  }

  type Query {
    # This is only here to satisfy the requirement that at least one
    # field be present within the 'Query' type.  This example does not
    # demonstrate how to fetch uploads back.
    otherFields: Boolean!
  }

  type Mutation {
    # Multiple uploads are supported. See graphql-upload docs for details.
    singleUpload(file: Upload!): File!
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  // This maps the `Upload` scalar to the implementation provided
  // by the `graphql-upload` package.
  Upload: GraphQLUpload,

  Mutation: {
    singleUpload: async (parent, { file }) => {
      const { createReadStream, filename, mimetype, encoding } = await file;

      // Invoking the `createReadStream` will return a Readable Stream.
      // See https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams
      const stream = createReadStream();

      // This is purely for demonstration purposes and will overwrite the
      // local-file-output.txt in the current working directory on EACH upload.
      const out = require('fs').createWriteStream('local-file-output.txt');
      stream.pipe(out);
      await finished(out);

      return { filename, mimetype, encoding };
    },
  },
};

const app = require('fastify')({
  logger: true
});

const start = async () => {
  try {
    // Handle all requests that have the `Content-Type` header set as multipart
    app.addContentTypeParser('multipart', (request, payload, done) => {
      request.isMultipart = true;
      done();
    });

    // Format the request body to follow graphql-upload's
    app.addHook('preValidation', async function (request, reply) {
      if (!request.isMultipart) {
        return;
      }

      request.body = await processRequest(request.raw, reply.raw);
    });

    const server = new ApolloServer({
      typeDefs,
      resolvers,
      // Using graphql-upload without CSRF prevention is very insecure.
      csrfPrevention: true,
      cache: 'bounded',
      plugins: [
        ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
      ],
    });

    // Start Apollo Server
    await server.start();

    app.register(server.createHandler());
    await app.listen(3000);
  } catch (err) {
    app.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

start();
```
