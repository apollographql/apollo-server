> **Apollo Server 3 removes built-in support for subscriptions.** You can reenable support as [described below](#enabling-subscriptions).
>
> **Subscriptions are not currently supported in [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).**
>
> This article has been updated to use the `graphql-ws` library to add support for subscriptions to Apollo Server. We no longer recommend using the previously documented `subscriptions-transport-ws`, because this library is no longer actively maintained. For more information about the differences between the two libraries, see [Old `subscriptions-transport-ws` library](#old-subscriptions-transport-ws-library).

**Subscriptions** are long-lasting GraphQL read operations that can update their result whenever a particular server-side event occurs. Most commonly, updated results are _pushed_ from the server to subscribing clients. For example, a chat application's server might use a subscription to push newly received messages to all clients in a particular chat room.

Because subscription updates are usually pushed by the server (instead of polled by the client), they usually use [the WebSocket protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) instead of HTTP.

> **Important:** Compared to queries and mutations, subscriptions are significantly more complex to implement. Before you begin, [confirm that your use case requires subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#when-to-use-subscriptions).

## Schema definition

Your schema's `Subscription` type defines top-level fields that clients can subscribe to:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  postCreated: Post
}
```

The `postCreated` field will update its value whenever a new `Post` is created on the backend, thus pushing the `Post` to subscribing clients.

Clients can subscribe to the `postCreated` field with a GraphQL string, like this:

```graphql
subscription PostFeed {
  postCreated {
    author
    comment
  }
}
```

> Each subscription operation can subscribe to only _one_ field of the `Subscription` type.

## Enabling subscriptions

> Beginning in Apollo Server 3, subscriptions are **not** supported by the "batteries-included" `apollo-server` package. To enable subscriptions, you must first [swap to the `apollo-server-express` package](../integrations/middleware/#swapping-out-apollo-server) (or any other Apollo Server integration package that supports subscriptions).
>
> The following steps assume you've already swapped to `apollo-server-express`.

To run both an Express app _and_ a separate WebSocket server for subscriptions, we'll create an `http.Server` instance that effectively wraps the two and becomes our new `listen`er.

1. Install `graphql-ws`, `ws`, and `@graphql-tools/schema`:
    ```bash
    npm install graphql-ws ws @graphql-tools/schema
    ```

2. Add the following imports to the file where you initialize your `ApolloServer` instance (we'll use these in later steps):

    ```ts:title=index.ts
    import { createServer } from 'http';
    import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';
    import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
    import { useServer } from 'graphql-ws/lib/use/ws';
    ```

3. Next, in order to set up both the HTTP and subscription servers, we need to first create an `http.Server`. Do this by passing your Express `app` to the `createServer` function, which we imported from the `http` module:

    ```ts:title=index.ts
    // This `app` is the returned value from `express()`.
    const httpServer = createServer(app);
    ```

4. Create an instance of `GraphQLSchema` (if you haven't already).

    > If you already pass the `schema` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor (instead of `typeDefs` and `resolvers`), you can skip this step.

    The subscription server (which we'll instantiate next) doesn't take `typeDefs` and `resolvers` options. Instead, it takes an executable `GraphQLSchema`. We can pass this `schema` object to both the subscription server and `ApolloServer`. This way, we make sure that the same schema is being used in both places.

    ```ts:title=index.ts
    const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });
    // ...
    const server = new ApolloServer({
      schema,
    });
    ```

5. Create a `WebSocketServer` to use as your subscription server.

    ```ts:title=index.ts
      // Creating the WebSocket server
      const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
        // This is the `httpServer` we created in a previous step.
        server: httpServer,
        // Pass a different path here if your ApolloServer serves at
        // a different path.
        path: '/graphql',
      });

      // Hand in the schema we just created and have the
      // WebSocketServer start listening.
      useServer({ schema }, wsServer);
    ```

6. Add [a plugin](../integrations/plugins) to your `ApolloServer` constructor to close the `WebSocketServer`:

    ```ts:title=index.ts
    const server = new ApolloServer({
      schema,
      plugins: [{
        async serverWillStart() {
          return {
            async drainServer() {
              await wsServer.close();
            }
          };
        }
      }],
    });
    ```

7. Finally, ensure you are `listen`ing to your `httpServer`.

    Most Express applications call `app.listen(...)`. **Change this to `httpServer.listen(...)`** with the same arguments. This way, the server starts listening on the HTTP and WebSocket transports simultaneously.

A completed example of migrating subscriptions is shown below:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts:title=index.ts
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server-express';
import { createServer } from 'http';
import express from 'express';
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import { useServer } from 'graphql-ws/lib/use/ws';
import resolvers from './resolvers';
import typeDefs from './typeDefs';

// Create the schema, which will be used separately by ApolloServer and
// the websocket server.
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });

// Set up ApolloServer.
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async drainServer() {
            await wsServer.close();
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});
await server.start();


// Set up HTTP.
const app = express();
const httpServer = createServer(app);
server.applyMiddleware({ app });

// Create our WebSocket server using the HTTP server we just set up.
const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
  server: httpServer,
  path: '/graphql',
});
useServer({ schema }, wsServer);

const PORT = 4000;
httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(
    `Server is now running on http://localhost:${PORT}${server.graphqlPath}`,
  );
});
```

## Resolving a subscription

Resolvers for `Subscription` fields differ from resolvers for fields of other types. Specifically, `Subscription` field resolvers are **objects** that define a `subscribe` function:

```ts:title=index.ts
const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    postCreated: {
      // More on pubsub below
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator(['POST_CREATED']),
    },
  },
  // ...other resolvers...
};
```

The `subscribe` function **must** return an object of type `AsyncIterator`, a standard interface for iterating over asynchronous results. In the example above, an `AsyncIterator` is generated by `pubsub.asyncIterator` (more on this below).


### The `PubSub` class

> The `PubSub` class is **not** recommended for production environments, because it's an in-memory event system that only supports a single server instance. After you get subscriptions working in development, we strongly recommend switching it out for a different subclass of the abstract [`PubSubEngine` class](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/blob/master/src/pubsub-engine.ts). Recommended subclasses are listed in [Production `PubSub` libraries](#production-pubsub-libraries).

Apollo Server uses a **publish-subscribe** (**pub/sub**) model to track events that update active subscriptions. The [`graphql-subscriptions` library](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions) provides the `PubSub` class as a basic in-memory event bus to help you get started:

To use the `graphql-subscriptions` package, first install it like so:

```shell
npm install graphql-subscriptions
```

A `PubSub` instance enables your server code to both `publish` events to a particular label and listen for events associated with a particular label. We can create a `PubSub` instance like so:
```js
import { PubSub } from 'graphql-subscriptions';

const pubsub = new PubSub();
```

### Publishing an event

You can publish an event using the `publish` method of a `PubSub` instance:

```js
pubsub.publish('POST_CREATED', {
  postCreated: {
    author: 'Ali Baba',
    comment: 'Open sesame'
  }
});
```

* The first parameter is the name of the event label you're publishing to, as a string.
    * _You don't need to register a label name before publishing to it._
* The second parameter is the payload associated with the event.
    * _The payload should include whatever data is necessary for your resolvers to populate the associated `Subscription` field and its subfields._

When working with GraphQL subscriptions, you `publish` an event whenever a subscription's return value should be updated. One common cause of such an update is a mutation, but _any_ back-end logic might result in changes that should be `publish`ed.

As an example, let's say our GraphQL API supports a `createPost` mutation:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createPost(author: String, comment: String): Post
}
```

A basic resolver for `createPost` might look like this:

```js{3-6}
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    createPost(parent, args, context) {
      // Datastore logic lives in postController
      return postController.createPost(args);
    },
  },
  // ...other resolvers...
};
```

Before we persist the new post's details in our datastore, we can `publish` an event that _also_ includes those details:

```js
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    createPost(parent, args, context) {
      pubsub.publish('POST_CREATED', { postCreated: args }); // highlight-line
      return postController.createPost(args);
    },
  },
  // ...other resolvers...
};
```

Next, we can listen for this event in our `Subscription` field's resolver.

### Listening for events

An [`AsyncIterator`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/blob/master/src/pubsub-async-iterator.ts) object listens for events that are associated with a particular label (or set of labels) and adds them to a queue for processing.

You can create an `AsyncIterator` by calling the `asyncIterator` method of `PubSub` and passing in an array containing the names of the event labels that this `AsyncIterator` should listen for.

```js
pubsub.asyncIterator(['POST_CREATED']);
```

Every `Subscription` field resolver's `subscribe` function must return an `AsyncIterator` object.

This brings us back to the code sample at the top of [Resolving a subscription](#resolving-a-subscription):

```js:title=index.js
const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    postCreated: {
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator(['POST_CREATED']),
    },
  },
  // ...other resolvers...
};
```

With this `subscribe` function set, Apollo Server uses the payloads of `POST_CREATED` events to push updated values for the `postCreated` field.

### Filtering events

Sometimes, a client should only receive updated subscription data if that data meets certain criteria. To support this, you can call the `withFilter` helper function in your `Subscription` field's resolver.

#### Example

Let's say our server provides a `commentAdded` subscription, which should notify clients whenever a comment is added to a specified code repository. A client can execute a subscription that looks like this:

```graphql
subscription($repoName: String!){
  commentAdded(repoFullName: $repoName) {
    id
    content
  }
}
```

This presents a potential issue: our server probably [publishes](#publishing-an-event) a `COMMENT_ADDED` event whenever a comment is added to _any_ repository. This means that the `commentAdded` resolver executes for _every_ new comment, regardless of which repository it's added to. As a result, subscribing clients might receive data they don't want (or shouldn't even have access to).

To fix this, we can use the `withFilter` helper function to control updates on a per-client basis.

Here's an example resolver for `commentAdded` that uses the `withFilter` function:

```js{5-12}
import { withFilter } from 'graphql-subscriptions';

const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    commentAdded: {
      subscribe: withFilter(
        () => pubsub.asyncIterator('COMMENT_ADDED'),
        (payload, variables) => {
          // Only push an update if the comment is on
          // the correct repository for this operation
          return (payload.commentAdded.repository_name === variables.repoFullName);
        },
      ),
    }
  },
    // ...other resolvers...
};
```

The `withFilter` function takes two parameters:

* The first parameter is exactly the function you would use for `subscribe` if you _weren't_ applying a filter.
* The second parameter is a **filter function** that returns `true` if a subscription update _should_ be sent to a particular client, and `false` otherwise (`Promise<boolean>` is also allowed). This function takes two parameters of its own:
    * `payload` is the payload of the event that was published.
    * `variables` is an object containing all arguments the client provided when initiating their subscription.

Use `withFilter` to make sure clients get exactly the subscription updates they want (and are allowed to receive).


## Basic runnable example

An example server is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/docs-examples/blob/main/apollo-server/v3/subscriptions-graphql-ws/src/index.ts) and CodeSandbox:

<a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/apollographql/docs-examples/tree/main/apollo-server/v3/subscriptions-graphql-ws?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&initialpath=%2Fgraphql&theme=dark">
  <img alt="Edit server-subscriptions-as3" src="https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg" />
</a>


The server exposes one subscription (`numberIncremented`) that returns an integer that's incremented on the server every second. Here's an example subscription that you can run against your server:

```graphql
subscription IncrementingNumber {
  numberIncremented
}
```

After you start up the server in CodeSandbox, follow the instructions in the browser to test running the `numberIncremented` subscription in Apollo Sandbox. You should see the subscription's value update every second.

> If you don't see the result of your subscription operation you might need to [adjust your Sandbox settings to use the `graphql-ws` protocol](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/additional-features/#subscription-support).

## Operation context

When [initializing context](../data/resolvers/#the-context-argument) for a query or mutation, you usually extract HTTP headers and other request metadata from the `req` object provided to the `context` function.

**For subscriptions,** you can extract information from a client's request by adding [options](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/docs/interfaces/server.ServerOptions.md) to the first argument passed to the `useServer` function. For example, can supply a `context` option to dynamically add values of your [GraphQL `context` function](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/docs/interfaces/server.ServerOptions.md#context):
```ts
// ...
useServer(
  {
    // Our GraphQL schema.
    schema,
    // Adding a context option allows you to add data to your GraphQL context
     context: (ctx, msg, args) => {
       // You can define your own function for setting a dynamic context
       // or provide a static value
      return getDynamicContext(ctx, msg, args);
    },
  },
  wsServer,
);
```

Now here is where things might get a little bit confusing, notice above that the `context` option's first argument is `ctx`, also known as context. _What?_ The [`Context`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/docs/interfaces/server.Context.md) type in `graphql-ws` is **not the same thing** as the GraphQL `context` function passed to your resolvers.

The `Context` type from `graphql-ws` is where information about your subscription server and its requests resides. You can access any incoming parameters from a client `subscription` request by checking the `Context.connectionParams`.

Below is an example of the common use case of extracting an authentication token from a client `subscription` request and using it to find the current user:

```ts
const getDynamicContext = (ctx, msg, args) => {
  // ctx is the graphql-ws Context where connectionParams live
 if (ctx.connectionParams.authorization) {
    const currentUser = await findUser(connectionParams.authorization);
    return { currentUser };
  }
  // Otherwise let our resolvers know we don't have a current user
  return { currentUser: null };
};

useServer(
  {
    schema,
     context: (ctx, msg, args) => {
       // Returning an object will add that information to our
       // GraphQL context, which all of our resolvers have access to.
      return getDynamicContext(ctx, msg, args);
    },
  },
  wsServer,
);
```
Putting it all together, if the `useServer.context` property returns an object, that object is passed to the GraphQL operation `context` of your resolvers.

Note that the `context` option is called once per `subscription` request, not once per event emission. Meaning that in the above example, every time a client sends a `subscription` GraphQL operation we would check their authentication status.

### `onConnect` and `onDisconnect`

Expanding on the above, you can add additional options for the subscription server to execute whenever a client connects (`onConnect`) or disconnects (`onDisconnect`).

Defining an `onConnect` function allows you to reject a particular incoming connection by returning false or by throwing an exception. This can be helpful if you'd like to check authentication when a client connects to your subscription server.

You provide these functions as options to the first argument of `useServer`, like so:

```ts{4,7}
useServer(
  {
    schema,
    // As before, ctx is the graphql-ws Context where connectionParams live.
    onConnect: async (ctx) => {
      // Check authentication every time a client connects.
      if (tokenIsNotValid(ctx.connectionParams)) {
        // You can return false to close the connect or throw an explicit error
        throw new Error('Auth token missing!');
      }
    },
    onDisconnect(ctx, code, reason) {
      console.log('Disconnected!');
    },
  },
  wsServer,
);
```
For more information and examples of using `onConnect` and `onDisconnect`, see the [`graphql-ws` documentation](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws#ws-auth-handling).

### Example: Authentication with the Server and Client

>If you plan to use subscriptions with Apollo Client, ensure **[both your client and server subscription protocols are consistent](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#choice-of-subscription-protocol)** for the subscription library you are using (this example uses the `graphql-ws` library).

On the client side, the `GraphQLWsLink` constructor supports adding information to `connectionParams` ([example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#5-authenticate-over-websocket-optional)). Those `connectionParams` are sent to your server when it connects, allowing you to extract information from the client request by accessing `Context.connectionParams`.

Let's suppose we create our subscription client like so:

```js
import { GraphQLWsLink } from '@apollo/client/link/subscriptions';
import { createClient } from 'graphql-ws';

const wsLink = new GraphQLWsLink(createClient({
  url: 'ws://localhost:4000/subscriptions',
  connectionParams: {
    authorization: user.authToken,
  },
}));
```

The `connectionParams` argument, containing the information provided in by the client, will be passed to your server allowing you to validate the user's credentials.

From there you can use the [`useServer.context` property](#operation-context) to try and authenticate the user, returning an object which will be passed into your resolvers as the `context` argument during execution.

For our example, we can use the `connectionParams.authentication` value provided by the client to look up the related user and pass that user along to our resolvers:

```js
async function findUser(authToken) {
  // find a user by auth token
};

const getDynamicContext = (ctx, msg, args) => {
 if (ctx.connectionParams.authentication) {
    const currentUser = await findUser(connectionParams.authentication);
    return { currentUser };
  }
  // Let the resolvers know we don't have a current user so they can
  // throw the appropriate error
  return { currentUser: null };
};

// ...
useServer(
  {
    // Our GraphQL schema.
    schema,
     context: (ctx, msg, args) => {
       // This will be run every time a subscription request from the client is made
      return getDynamicContext(ctx, msg, args);
    },
  },
  wsServer,
);
```

The example above looks up a user based on the authentication token that is sent with each subscription request, then returns the user object to be used by our resolvers. If no user exists or if lookup fails, our resolvers can throw an error and the corresponding `subscription` operation is not executed.

## Production `PubSub` libraries

[As mentioned above](#the-pubsub-class), the `PubSub` class is _not_ recommended for production environments, because its event-publishing system is in-memory. This means that events published by _one_ instance of your GraphQL server are not received by subscriptions that are handled by _other_ instances.

Instead, you should use a subclass of the [`PubSubEngine` abstract class](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/blob/master/src/pubsub-engine.ts) that you can back with an external datastore such as Redis or Kafka.

The following are community-created `PubSub` libraries for popular event-publishing systems:

- [Redis](https://github.com/davidyaha/graphql-redis-subscriptions)
- [Google PubSub](https://github.com/axelspringer/graphql-google-pubsub)
- [MQTT enabled broker](https://github.com/davidyaha/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions)
- [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/cdmbase/graphql-rabbitmq-subscriptions)
- [Kafka](https://github.com/ancashoria/graphql-kafka-subscriptions)
- [Postgres](https://github.com/GraphQLCollege/graphql-postgres-subscriptions)
- [Google Cloud Firestore](https://github.com/MrBoolean/graphql-firestore-subscriptions)
- [Ably Realtime](https://github.com/ably-labs/graphql-ably-pubsub)
- [Google Firebase Realtime Database](https://github.com/swantzter/graphql-firebase-subscriptions)
- [Azure SignalR Service](https://github.com/aaronpowell/graphql-azure-subscriptions)

If none of these libraries fits your use case, you can also create your own `PubSubEngine` subclass. If you create a new open-source library, click **Edit on GitHub** to let us know about it!

## Old `subscriptions-transport-ws` library

>If use subscriptions with Apollo Client you must ensure **[both your client and server subscription protocols are consistent](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#choice-of-subscription-protocol)** for the subscription library you are using.

This article details how to setup the [`graphql-ws`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-ws) library to add support for subscriptions to Apollo Server. Previously this article recommended using the `subscriptions-transport-ws` library, however this library is no longer actively maintained. Apollo Client does support both `graphql-ws` and `subscriptions-transport-ws`, but we recommend using the currently maintained `graphql-ws` library.

The two libraries implement different protocols for GraphQL subscriptions over websockets. If you do decide to switch from one library to another, you will need to ensure your [Apollo Client subscription protocol](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#choice-of-subscription-protocol) is **consistent** with the subscription library you are using within Apollo Server and vice versa. Note that you might need to [adjust the Apollo Sandbox settings to use the same subscription protocol as the library you are using](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/additional-features/#subscription-support).

For more information on using Apollo Server with `subscriptions-transport-ws`, you can view the [previous version of this article here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/4b82967c10a69aa104848a8c9d15c591b528918c/docs/source/data/subscriptions.mdx).
