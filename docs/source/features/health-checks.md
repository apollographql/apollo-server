title: Health checks
description: Determining the health status of the Apollo Server 
---

Health checks are often used by load balancers to determine if a server is available and ready to start serving traffic.  By default, Apollo Server provides a health check endpoint at `/.well-known/apollo/server-health` which returns a 200 status code if the server has started.

This basic health check may not be comprehensive enough for some applications and depending on individual circumstances, it may be beneficial to provide a more thorough implementation by defining an `onHealthCheck` function to the `ApolloServer` constructor options.  If defined, this `onHealthCheck` function should return a `Promise` which _rejects_ if there is an error, or _resolves_ if the server is deemed _ready_.  A `Promise` _rejection_ will result in an HTTP status code of 503, and a _resolution_ will result in an HTTP status code of 200, which is generally desired by most health-check tooling (e.g. Kubernetes, AWS, etc.).

> **Note:** Alternatively, the `onHealthCheck` can be defined as an `async` function which `throw`s if it encounters an error and returns when conditions are considered normal.

```js{10-19}
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

// Undefined for brevity.
const typeDefs = gql``;
const resolvers = {};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  onHealthCheck: () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // Replace the `true` in this conditional with more specific checks!
      if (true) {
        resolve();
      } else {
        reject();
      }
    });
  },
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
  console.log(
    `Try your health check at: ${url}.well-known/apollo/server-health`,
  );
});
```
