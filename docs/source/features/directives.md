title: Using schema directives
description: Using schema directives to transform schema types, fields, and arguments
---

A _directive_ is an identifier preceded by a `@` character, optionally followed by a list of named arguments, which can appear after almost any form of syntax in the GraphQL query or schema languages. Here's an example from the [GraphQL draft specification](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec-Type-System.Directives) that illustrates several of these possibilities:

```typescript
directive @deprecated(
  reason: String = "No longer supported"
) on FIELD_DEFINITION | ENUM_VALUE

type ExampleType {
  newField: String
  oldField: String @deprecated(reason: "Use `newField`.")
}
```

As you can see, the usage of `@deprecated(reason: ...)` _follows_ the field that it pertains to (`oldField`), though the syntax might remind you of "decorators" in other languages, which usually appear on the line above. Directives are typically _declared_ once, using the `directive @deprecated ... on ...` syntax, and then _used_ zero or more times throughout the schema document, using the `@deprecated(reason: ...)` syntax.

## Default Directives

GraphQL provides several default directives: [`@deprecated`](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec--deprecated), [`@skip`](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec--skip), and [`@include`](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec--include).

  * [`@deprecated`](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec--deprecated)`(reason: String)` - marks field as deprecated with message
  * [`@skip`](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec--skip)`(if: Boolean!)` - GraphQL execution skips the field if true by not calling the resolver
  * [`@include`](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec--include)`(if: Boolean!)` - Calls resolver for annotated field if true

## Using custom schema directives

Import the implementation of the directive, then pass it to Apollo server via the `schemaDirectives` argument, which is an object that maps directive names to directive implementations:

```js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { RenameDirective } = require('rename-directive-package');

const typeDefs = gql`
type Person @rename(to: "Human") {
  name: String!
  currentDateMinusDateOfBirth: Int @rename(to: "age")
}`;

//Create and start your apollo server
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  schemaDirectives: {
    rename: RenameDirective,
  },
  app,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

The implementation of `RenameDirective` takes care of changing the resolver and modifying the schema if necessary. To learn how to implement your own schema directives, read through [this section](./creating-directives.html).
