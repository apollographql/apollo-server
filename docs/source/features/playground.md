description: Visually exploring a Apollo Server
---

[GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) is a graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE, created by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), based on [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql). In development, Apollo Server collocates a GraphQL Playground instance with the GraphQL path. When a browser sends a request to Apollo Server, it receives the GraphQL Playground gui. When `NODE_ENV` is set to production, introspection and Playground are disabled as a production best practice.

## Enabling Playground in Production

To enable Playground in production, an integration package must be installed to provide more control over the middlewares used. The following example uses the express integration:

```bash
npm install --save apollo-server-express@rc graphql
```

Introspection and the gui can be enabled explicitly in the following manner.

```js line=8,16
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');
const express = require('express');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: true,
});

const app = express();

// gui accepts a Playground configuration
server.applyMiddleware({
  app,
  gui: true,
});

app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`),
);
```

> Note: when using apollo-server-express, you can remove apollo-server from your package.json
