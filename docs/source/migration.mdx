title: Migrating to Apollo Server 3
---

import { ExpansionPanel } from 'gatsby-theme-apollo-docs';

Apollo Server 3 is generally available.

The focus of this major-version release is to provide a lighter, nimbler core library as a foundation for future features and improved extensibility.

**Many Apollo Server 2 users don't need to make any code changes to upgrade to Apollo Server 3!** This is especially likely if you use the "batteries-included" `apollo-server` library (as opposed to a [middleware-specific library](./integrations/middleware/)).

This document explains which features _do_ require code changes and how to make them. If you encounter issues while migrating, please [create an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/new/choose).

> For a list of all breaking changes, [see the changelog](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).


## Bumped dependencies

### Node.js

**Apollo Server 3 supports Node.js 12 and later.** (Apollo Server 2 supports back to Node.js 6.) This includes [all LTS and Current versions at the time of release](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/).

If you're using an older version of Node.js, upgrade your runtime before upgrading to Apollo Server 3.

### `graphql`

Apollo Server has a peer dependency on [`graphql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) (the core JS GraphQL implementation), which means you are responsible for choosing the version installed in your app.

**Apollo Server 3 supports `graphql` v15.3.0 and later.** (Apollo Server 2 supported `graphql` v0.12 through v15.)

If you're using an older version of `graphql`, upgrade it to a supported version before upgrading to Apollo Server 3.

## Removed integrations

Apollo Server 2 provides built-in support for subscriptions and file uploads via the `subscriptions-transport-ws` and `graphql-upload` packages, respectively. It also serves GraphQL Playground from its base URL by default.

Apollo Server 3 removes these built-in integrations, in favor of enabling users to provide their own mechanisms for these features.

You can reenable all of these integrations as they exist in Apollo Server 2.

### Subscriptions

Apollo Server 2 provides limited, built-in support for WebSocket-based GraphQL subscriptions via the `subscriptions-transport-ws` package. This integration doesn't work with Apollo Server's plugin system or Apollo Studio usage reporting.

Apollo Server 3 no longer contains this built-in integration. However, you can still use `subscriptions-transport-ws` for subscriptions if you depend on this implementation. Note that as with Apollo Server 2, this integration won't work with the plugin system or Studio usage reporting.

Additionally, Apollo Server 3 [no longer re-exports all of the exports from the `graphql-subscriptions` package](#exports-from-graphql-subscriptions) such as `PubSub`.

We hope to add more fully-integrated subscription support to Apollo Server in a future version.

> Note that the `subscriptions-transport-ws` library is not actively maintained. An alternative, actively-maintained `graphql-ws` package exists, which we intend to support in a future release. These libraries implement different protocols for GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket, so you need to adjust your client to support `graphql-ws`. At the time of release of Apollo Server 3, the `graphql-ws` protocol is not yet supported by GraphQL Playground or the Apollo Studio Explorer.

#### Reenabling subscriptions

> Currently, these instructions are only for Apollo Server's Express integration. It is likely possible to integrate `subscriptions-transport-ws` with other integrations. PRs to this migration guide are certainly welcome!

In Apollo Server 3, you can't use `subscriptions-transport-ws` with the "batteries-included" `apollo-server` package. If your project uses `apollo-server` with subscriptions, first [swap to `apollo-server-express`](./integrations/middleware/#swapping-out-apollo-server).

Then, complete the following:

1. Install `subscriptions-transport-ws` and `@graphql-tools/schema`.
    ```shell
    npm install subscriptions-transport-ws @graphql-tools/schema
    ```

1. Add the following imports in the module where your Apollo Server is currently instantiated. We'll use these in the subsequent steps.
    ```javascript
    import { createServer } from 'http';
    import { execute, subscribe } from 'graphql';
    import { SubscriptionServer } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';
    import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';
    ```

1. Create an `http.Server` instance with your Express `app`.

    In order to set up both the HTTP and WebSocket servers, we'll need to create an `http.Server`. Do this by passing your Express `app` to the `createServer` function which we imported from the Node.js `http` module.

    ```javascript
    // This `app` is the returned value from `express()`.
    const httpServer = createServer(app);
    ```

1. Create an instance of `GraphQLSchema` (if one doesn't already exist).
    > Your server may already pass a `schema` to the `ApolloServer` constructor. If it does, this step can be skipped. You'll use the existing `schema` instance in a later step.

    The `SubscriptionServer` (which we'll instantiate next) doesn't accept `typeDefs` and `resolvers` directly, but rather an executable `GraphQLSchema`. We can pass this `schema` object to both the `SubscriptionServer` and `ApolloServer`. This way, it's clear that the same schema is being used in both places.

    ```javascript
    const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });
    // ...
    const server = new ApolloServer({
      schema,
    });
    ```

1. Create the `SubscriptionServer`.

    ```javascript
    const subscriptionServer = SubscriptionServer.create({
      // This is the `schema` we just created.
      schema,
      // These are imported from `graphql`.
      execute,
      subscribe,
      // Providing `onConnect` is the `SubscriptionServer` equivalent to the
      // `context` function in `ApolloServer`. Please [see the docs](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws#constructoroptions-socketoptions--socketserver)
      // for more information on this hook.
      async onConnect(
        connectionParams: Object,
        webSocket: WebSocket,
        context: ConnectionContext
      ) {
        // If an object is returned here, it will be passed as the `context`
        // argument to your subscription resolvers.
      }
    }, {
      // This is the `httpServer` we created in a previous step.
      server: httpServer,
      // This `server` is the instance returned from `new ApolloServer`.
      path: server.graphqlPath,
    });

    // Shut down in the case of interrupt and termination signals
    // We expect to handle this more cleanly in the future. See (#5074)[https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/5074] for reference.
    ['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM'].forEach(signal => {
      process.on(signal, () => subscriptionServer.close());
    });
    ```

1. Finally, adjust the existing `listen`.

    Most applications will be calling `app.listen(...)` on their Express app. **This should be changed to `httpServer.listen(...)`** using the same arguments. This will begin listening on the HTTP and WebSocket transports simultaneously.

A completed example of migrating subscriptions is shown below:
<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

```js
import { createServer } from "http";
import { execute, subscribe } from "graphql";
import { SubscriptionServer } from "subscriptions-transport-ws";
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import express from "express";
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server-express";
import resolvers from "./resolvers";
import typeDefs from "./typeDefs";

(async function () {
  const app = express();

  const httpServer = createServer(app);

  const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  });

  const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema,
    context() {
      // lookup userId by token, etc.
      return { userId };
    }
  });
  await server.start();
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });

  const subscriptionServer = SubscriptionServer.create({
    schema,
    execute,
    subscribe,
    onConnect() {
      // lookup userId by token, etc.
      return { userId };
    },
  }, {
    server: httpServer,
    path: server.graphqlPath,
  });

  // Shut down in the case of interrupt and termination signals
  // We expect to handle this more cleanly in the future. See (#5074)[https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/5074] for reference.
  ['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM'].forEach(signal => {
    process.on(signal, () => subscriptionServer.close());
  });

  const PORT = 4000;
  httpServer.listen(PORT, () =>
    console.log(`Server is now running on http://localhost:${PORT}/graphql`)
  );
})();
```
</ExpansionPanel>

### File uploads

Apollo Server 2 provides built-in support for file uploads via an outdated version of the `graphql-upload` library. Using an updated version of `graphql-upload` requires you to disable this built-in support due to backward incompatible changes.

This built-in support is removed in Apollo Server 3. To use `graphql-upload`, you can choose an appropriate version and integrate it yourself. Note that `graphql-upload` does not support federation or every [Node.js framework](./integrations/middleware/) supported by Apollo Server.

To use `graphql-upload` with Apollo Server 3, see the [documentation on enabling file uploads in Apollo Server](../data/file-uploads/). Note that if your project currently uses uploads with the "batteries-included" `apollo-server` package, you must first [swap to `apollo-server-express`](./integrations/middleware/#swapping-out-apollo-server).

Additionally, Apollo Server 3 [no longer re-exports the `GraphQLUpload` symbol from the `graphql-uploads` package](#exports-from-graphql-upload).

### GraphQL Playground

By default, Apollo Server 2 serves the (now-[retired](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/issues/1143)) [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) IDE from its base URL in non-production environments. In production, it serves no landing page. Apollo Server 2 also accepts a `playground` constructor option to override this default behavior (for example, to enable GraphQL Playground even in production).

Apollo Server 3 removes GraphQL Playground (and its associated constructor option) in favor of a landing page that links to Apollo Sandbox in non-production environments. In production, it serves a simplified landing page instead.

You can customize your Apollo Server 3 landing page, as described in [Build and run queries](./testing/build-run-queries/).

#### Reenabling GraphQL Playground

You can continue to use GraphQL Playground by installing its associated plugin. You customize its behavior by passing options to the plugin instead of via the `playground` constructor option.

If your code did not specify the `playground` constructor option and you'd like to keep the previous behavior instead of trying the new splash page, you can do that as follows:

```javascript
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground,
         ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled } from 'apollo-server-core';
new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled()
      : ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground(),
  ],
});
```

If your code passed `new ApolloServer({playground: true})`, you can keep the previous behavior with:

```javascript
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } from 'apollo-server-core';
new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground(),
  ],
});
```

If your code passed `new ApolloServer({playground: false})` you can keep the previous behavior with:

```javascript
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled } from 'apollo-server-core';
new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled(),
  ],
});
```

If your code passed an options object like `new ApolloServer({playground: playgroundOptions})`, you can keep the previous behavior with:

```javascript
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } from 'apollo-server-core';
new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground(playgroundOptions),
  ],
});
```

#### Additional changes to GraphQL Playground

##### Specifying an `endpoint`

In Apollo Server 2, the default value of GraphQL Playground's `endpoint` option is determined in different ways by different Node.js framework integrations. In many cases, it's necessary to manually specify `playground: {endpoint}`.

In Apollo Server 3, the default endpoint used by GraphQL Playground is the browser's current URL. In many cases, this means that you don't have to specify `endpoint` anymore. If your Apollo Server 2 app specified `playground: {endpoint}` (and you wish to continue using GraphQL Playground), try removing `endpoint` from the options passed to `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` and see if it works for you.

##### Specifying `settings`

In Apollo Server 2, the behavior of the `settings` GraphQL Playground option can be surprising. If you don't explicitly pass `{playground: {settings: {...}}}` then GraphQL Playground always uses settings that are built into its React application (some of which can be adjusted by the user in their browser). However, if you pass _any object_ as `playground: {settings: {...}}`, [several default value overrides](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/70a431212bd2d07d68c962cb5ded63ecc6a21963/packages/apollo-server-core/src/playground.ts#L38-L46) take effect.

This surprising behavior is removed in Apollo Server 3. All `settings` use default values from the GraphQL Playground React app if they aren't specified in the `settings` option to `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground`.

If your app does pass in `playground: {settings: {...}}` and you want to make sure the settings used in your GraphQL Playground do not change, you should copy any relevant settings from [the Apollo Server 2 code](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/70a431212bd2d07d68c962cb5ded63ecc6a21963/packages/apollo-server-core/src/playground.ts#L38-L46) into your app.

For example, you could replace:

```javascript
new ApolloServer({playground: {settings: {'some.setting': true}}})
```

with:

```javascript
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } from 'apollo-server-core';
new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({
      settings: {
        'some.setting': true,
        'general.betaUpdates': false,
        'editor.theme': 'dark',
        'editor.cursorShape': 'line',
        'editor.reuseHeaders': true,
        'tracing.hideTracingResponse': true,
        'queryPlan.hideQueryPlanResponse': true,
        'editor.fontSize': 14,
        'editor.fontFamily': `'Source Code Pro', 'Consolas', 'Inconsolata', 'Droid Sans Mono', 'Monaco', monospace`,
        'request.credentials': 'omit',
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```


## Removed constructor options

The following `ApolloServer` constructor options have been removed in favor of other features or configuration methods.

### `extensions`

Apollo Server 3 removes support for the `graphql-extensions` API, which was used to extend Apollo Server's functionality. This API has numerous limitations relative to the [plugins API](./integrations/plugins/) introduced in Apollo Server v2.2.0.

Unlike `graphql-extensions`, the plugins API enables cross-request state, and its hooks virtually all interact with the same `GraphQLRequestContext` object.

If you've written your own extensions (passed to `new ApolloServer({extensions: ...})`), you should [rewrite them as plugins](./integrations/plugins/) before upgrading to Apollo Server 3.


### `engine`

"Engine" is a previous name of [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/). Prior to Apollo Server v2.18.0, you passed the `engine` constructor option to configure how Apollo Server communicates with Studio. Additionally, you could specifying your Apollo API key with the `ENGINE_API_KEY` environment variable, and you could specify a graph variant with the `ENGINE_SCHEMA_TAG` environment variable.

In later versions of Apollo Server (including Apollo Server 3), you instead provide this configuration via a combination of the `apollo` constructor option, plugins, and `APOLLO_`-prefixed environment variables. Apollo Server 3 does not support the `engine` constructor option or the `ENGINE_`-prefixed environment variables.

If your project still uses the `engine` option or the `ENGINE_`-prefixed environment variables, see [Migrating from the `engine` option](../v2/migration-engine-plugins) before upgrading to Apollo Server 3.

Note that if you are using Studio, make sure to [set your graph ref or graph ID](#guessing-apollo-studio-graph-id-from-api-key).

### `schemaDirectives`

In Apollo Server 2, you can pass `schemaDirectives` to `new ApolloServer` alongside `typeDefs` and `resolvers`. These arguments are all passed through to the [`makeExecutableSchema` function](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/generate-schema/#makeexecutableschemaoptions)  from the `graphql-tools` package. `graphql-tools` now considers `schemaDirectives` to be a [legacy feature](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/legacy-schema-directives/).

In Apollo Server 3, the `ApolloServer` constructor now only passes `typeDefs`, `resolvers`, and `parseOptions` through to `makeExecutableSchema`.

To provide other arguments to `makeExecutableSchema` (such as `schemaDirectives` or its replacement `schemaTransforms`), you can call `makeExecutableSchema` yourself and pass its returned schema as the `schema` constructor option.

That is, you can replace:

```javascript
new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  schemaDirectives,
});
```

with:

```javascript
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';

new ApolloServer({
  schema: makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    schemaDirectives,
  }),
});
```

> In Apollo Server 2, there are subtle differences between providing a schema with `schema` versus providing it with `typeDefs` and `resolvers`. For example, the automatic definition of the `@cacheControl` directive is added only in the latter case. These differences are removed in Apollo Server 3 (for example, the definition of the `@cacheControl` directive is _never_ automatically added).

### `tracing`

In Apollo Server 2, the `tracing` constructor option enables a trace mechanism implemented in the `apollo-tracing` package. This package uses a comparatively inefficient JSON format for execution traces returned via the `tracing` GraphQL response extension. The format is consumed only by the deprecated `engineproxy` and GraphQL Playground. It is _not_ the tracing format used for Apollo Studio usage reporting or federated inline traces.

The `tracing` constructor option is removed in Apollo Server 3. The `apollo-tracing` package has been deprecated and is no longer being published.

If you rely on this deprecated trace format, you might be able to use the old version of `apollo-server-tracing` directly:

```javascript
new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    require('apollo-tracing').plugin()
  ]
});
```

> This workaround has not been tested! If you need this to work and it doesn't, please file an issue and we will investigate a fix to enable support in Apollo Server 3.

### `cacheControl`

In Apollo Server 2, [cache policy support](../performance/caching/) is configured via the `cacheControl` constructor option. There are several improvements to the semantics of cache policies in Apollo Server 3, as well as changes to how caching is configured.

The `cacheControl` constructor option is removed in Apollo Server 3. To customize cache control, you instead manually install the [cache control plugin](./api/plugin/cache-control/) and provide custom options to it.

For example, if you currently provide `defaultMaxAge` and/or `calculateHttpHeaders` to `cacheControl` like so:

```javascript
new ApolloServer({
  cacheControl: {
    defaultMaxAge,
    calculateHttpHeaders,
  },
});
```

You now provide them like so:

```javascript
import { ApolloServerPluginCacheControl } from 'apollo-server-core';

new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginCacheControl({
      defaultMaxAge,
      calculateHttpHeaders,
    }),
  ],
})
```

If you currently pass `cacheControl: false` like so:

```javascript
new ApolloServer({
  cacheControl: false,
});
```

You now install the disabling plugin like so:

```javascript
import { ApolloServerPluginCacheControlDisabled } from 'apollo-server-core';

new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginCacheControlDisabled(),
  ],
})
```

In Apollo Server 2, `cacheControl: true` was a shorthand for setting `cacheControl: {stripFormattedExtensions: false, calculateHttpHeaders: false}`. If you either passed `cacheControl: true` or explicitly passed `stripFormattedExtensions: false`, Apollo Server 2 would include a `cacheControl` response extension inside your GraphQL response. This was used by the deprecated `engineproxy` server. Support for writing this response extension has been removed from Apollo Server 2. This allows for a more memory-efficient cache control plugin implementation.

In Apollo Server 2, definitions of the `@cacheControl` directive (and the `CacheControlScope` enum that it uses) were sometimes automatically inserted into your schema. (Specifically, they were added if you defined your schema with the `typeDefs` and `resolvers` options, but not if you used the `modules` or `schema` options or if you were a federated gateway. Passing `cacheControl: false` did not stop the definitions from being inserted!) In Apollo Server 3, these definitions are never automatically inserted.

So **if you use the `@cacheControl` directive in your schema, you should add these definitions to your schema**:

```graphql
enum CacheControlScope {
  PUBLIC
  PRIVATE
}

directive @cacheControl(
  maxAge: Int
  scope: CacheControlScope
  inheritMaxAge: Boolean
) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | UNION
```

(You may add them to your schema in Apollo Server 2 before upgrading if you'd like.)

In Apollo Server 2, plugins that want to change the operation's overall cache policy can overwrite the field `requestContext.overallCachePolicy`. In Apollo Server 3, that field is considered read-only, but it does have new methods to mutate its state. So you should replace:

```javascript
requestContext.overallCachePolicy = { maxAge: 100 };
```

with:

```javascript
requestContext.overallCachePolicy.replace({ maxAge: 100 });
```

(You may also want to consider using `restrict` instead of `replace`; this method only allows `maxAge` to be reduced and only allows `scope` to change from `PUBLIC` to `PRIVATE`.)

In Apollo Server 2, fields returning a union type are treated similarly to fields returning a scalar type: `@cacheControl` on the type itself is ignored, and `maxAge` if unspecified is inherited from its parent in the operation (unless it is a root field) instead of defaulting to `defaultMaxAge` (which itself defaults to 0). In Apollo Server 3, fields returning a union type are treated similarly to fields returning an interface or object type: `@cacheControl` on the type itself is honored, and `maxAge` if unspecified defaults to `defaultMaxAge`. If you were relying on the inheritance behavior, you can specify `@cacheControl(maxAge: ...)` explicitly on your union types or union-returning fields, or you can use the new `@cacheControl(inheritMaxAge: true)` feature on the union-returning field to restore the Apollo Server 2 behavior. If your schema contained `union SomeUnion @cacheControl(...)`, that directive will start having an effect when you upgrade to Apollo Server 3.

In Apollo Server 2, the `@cacheControl` is honored on type definitions but not on type extensions. That is, if you write `type SomeType @cacheControl(maxAge: 123)` it takes effect but if you write `extend type SomeType @cacheControl(maxAge: 123)` it does not take effect. In Apollo Server 3, `@cacheControl` is honored on object, interface, and union extensions. If your schema accidentally contained `@cacheControl` on an `extend`, that directive will start having an effect when you upgrade to Apollo Server 3.

In Apollo Server 2, most of the logic related to cache control lives in the `apollo-cache-control` package. This package exports a function called `plugin` as well as TypeScript types `CacheControlFormat`, `CacheHint`, `CacheScope`, and `CacheControlExtensionOptions`. In Apollo Server 3, this logic lives in `apollo-server-core` and the `apollo-cache-control` package is no longer published. `apollo-server-core` exports `ApolloServerPluginCacheControl` and `ApolloServerPluginCacheControlOptions` (which are similar to `plugin` and `CacheControlExtensionOptions`). `apollo-server-types` exports `CacheHint` and `CacheScope`. There is no equivalent export to `CacheControlFormat` because as described above, the code to write the `cacheControl` response extension is not part of Apollo Server 3.

### `playground`

See [GraphQL Playground](#graphql-playground).

## Removed exports

In Apollo Server 2, `apollo-server` and framework integration packages such as `apollo-server-express` import many symbols from third-party packages and re-export them. This effectively ties the API of Apollo Server to a specific version of those third-party packages and makes it challenging to upgrade to a newer version or for you to upgrade those packages yourself.

In Apollo Server 3, most of these "re-exports" are removed. If you want to use these exports, you should import them directly from their originating package.

### Exports from `graphql-tools`

Apollo Server 2 exports every symbol exported by [`graphql-tools`](https://www.graphql-tools.com/) v4. If you're importing any of the following symbols from an Apollo Server package, you should instead run `npm install graphql-tools@4.x` and import the symbol from `graphql-tools`.

> Alternatively, read the [GraphQL Tools docs](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/introduction) and find out which `@graphql-tools/subpackage` the symbol is exported from in more modern versions of GraphQL Tools.

### Exports from `graphql-subscriptions`

Apollo Server 2 exports every symbol exported by [`graphql-subscriptions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-subscriptions). If you are importing any of the following symbols from an Apollo Server package, you should instead run `npm install graphql-subscriptions` and import the symbol from `graphql-subscriptions` instead.

- `FilterFn`
- `PubSub`
- `PubSubEngine`
- `PubSubOptions`
- `ResolverFn`
- `withFilter`

### Exports from `graphql-upload`

Apollo Server 2 exports the `GraphQLUpload` symbol from (our fork of) `graphql-upload`. Apollo Server 3 no longer has built-in `graphql-upload` integration. See [the documentation on how to enable file uploads in Apollo Server 3](../data/file-uploads/).

### Exports related to GraphQL Playground

Apollo Server 2 exports a `defaultPlaygroundOptions` object, along with `PlaygroundConfig` and `PlaygroundRenderPageOptions` types to support the `playground` top-level constructor argument.

In Apollo Server 3, GraphQL Playground is one of several landing pages implemented via plugins, and there are no default options for it. The `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlaygroundOptions` type exported from `apollo-server-core` plays a similar role to `PlaygroundConfig` and `PlaygroundRenderPageOptions`. See [the section on `playground` above](#graphql-playground) for more details on configuring GraphQL Playground in Apollo Server 3.

## Removed features

Several small features have been removed from Apollo Server 3.

### Guessing Apollo Studio graph ID from API key

In Apollo Server 2, if you specify an Apollo API key (e.g., with the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable) that starts with `service:your-graph-id:`, Apollo Server automatically guesses that your Studio graph ID (used for usage reporting, schema reporting, managed federation, and so on) is `your-graph-id`.

In Apollo Server 3, you should instead specify your Studio graph ID explicitly when using features that connect to Studio. You can specify the graph ID by itself in the `APOLLO_GRAPH_ID` environment variable (or via `new ApolloServer({apollo: {graphId}}))`, or alongside the variant in a string like `your-graph-id@your-graph-variant` in the `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variable (or via `new ApolloServer({apollo: {graphRef}})`). See [the `apollo` constructor option](./api/apollo-server/#apollo) for more details.

> If you set your API key but do _not_ set your graph ref or ID:
> - If you explicitly set up features like the usage reporting plugin or managed federation, Apollo Server 3 throws an error on startup.
> - If you don't explicitly [set up or disable the usage reporting plugin](./api/plugin/usage-reporting/), Apollo Server 3 logs a warning suggesting that you either set your graph ref or disable the usage reporting plugin.

### `ApolloServer.schema` field

Apollo Server 2 has a deprecated field `ApolloServer.schema` (which doesn't work when the server is a federated gateway). Apollo Server 3 does not contain this field. To access your server's schema, you have a few options:

- Construct the schema yourself (e.g., with `const schema = makeExecutableSchema({typeDefs, resolvers})` from `@graphql-tools/schema`), pass it in as `new ApolloServer({schema})`, and refer to this same `schema` value elsewhere. Apollo Server 3 won't modify the schema you pass in.
- Write a plugin that uses the [`serverWillStart` event](./integrations/plugins-event-reference/#serverwillstart) to obtain the schema. Note that if your server is a gateway, this receives the _first_ schema that's loaded on startup but doesn't receive any subsequent schemas if it updates dynamically.
- If your server is a gateway, register a callback with `gateway.onSchemaChange`. Note that this API has some inconsistent behavior. To resolve this, we are considering [adding an Apollo Server plugin event that receives all schema updates](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/5187).

### `apollo-server-testing`

Apollo Server 2 contains a package `apollo-server-testing`. This package is a thin wrapper around the `server.executeOperation` method. As of Apollo Server 2.25.0, we no longer document this package and instead [document using `executeOperation` directly](../testing/testing/).

In Apollo Server 3, we no longer publish this package. It's possible that the Apollo Server 2 version of this package might work with Apollo Server 3 servers. If you do use `apollo-server-testing`, we suggest that you migrate to using `executeOperation` directly (with at least 2.25.0 of Apollo Server) before upgrading to Apollo Server 3.

If you used `apollo-server-testing` like so:

```javascript
const { createTestClient } = require('apollo-server-testing');
const { query, mutate } = createTestClient(server);
await query({ query: QUERY });
await mutate({ mutation: MUTATION });
```

then you can use `executeOperation` like so:

```javascript
await server.executeOperation({ query: QUERY });
await server.executeOperation({ query: MUTATION });
```

> Note that prior to Apollo Server 2.25.0, `apollo-server-testing` functions allowed you to pass your operation as a string or a `DocumentNode` as returned from `gql`, but `executeOperation` only supported strings. As of v2.25.0, `executeOperation` takes `string` or `DocumentNode`, which makes the change shown above straightforward in all cases.

### `apollo-datasource-rest`: `baseURL` override change

When you create a [`RESTDataSource`](../data/data-sources/) subclass, you need to provide its `baseURL`. This can be done via `this.baseURL = ...` in the constructor or `resolveURL`, or via `baseURL = ...` at the class level.

In Apollo Server 2 you can _also_ provide `baseURL` via a getter like `get baseURL() { ... }`. Apollo Server 3 is compiled with TypeScript 4, which [no longer supports overriding a property with an accessor](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/#properties-overriding-accessors-and-vice-versa-is-an-error), so this is no longer allowed.

If you used a getter in order to provide a dynamic URL, like this:

```javascript
class MyDataSource extends RESTDataSource {
  get baseURL() {
    return someDynamicallyCalculatedURL();
  }
}
```

you can instead override `resolveURL`:

```javascript
class MyDataSource extends RESTDataSource {
  async resolveURL(request: RequestOptions) {
    if (!this.baseURL) {
      this.baseURL = someDynamicallyCalculatedURL();
    }
    return super.resolveURL(request);
  }
}
```

### `apollo-server-env`'s global type definitions

Global TypeScript definitions have been removed from `apollo-server-env` since they conflicted with similar global types provided by `@types/supertest`, which we use in Apollo Server's test suite.  These removed types include types which resemble those of [the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) including, e.g., `fetch`, `RequestInfo`, `Headers`, `Request`, `Response`, `ResponseInit`, and more.  [See the full list prior to removal here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/32cfdcfdbd44f4f4e826f347f47fdcbc0475b5cc/packages/apollo-server-env/src/global.d.ts).

We don't expect this to affect many users and we have not publicly suggested using these types in the past, but it's possible that implementations may be using them inadvertently (e.g., from auto-import on `apollo-server-env`).  While other type definition sets provide similar hand-curated types, for the time being, we have chosen to rely the same-named types from TypeScript's `lib.dom.d.ts` — e.g., [its `RequestInfo` type definition](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/3c604f1c0a412ef41f58c3f9b239b25e8d725751/lib/lib.dom.d.ts#L1470).  Even if those types are more appropriate for browsers, they're a reliable and well-maintained source.  For more details, including our plan for adjusting this again in the future, [see PR #5165](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/5165).

## Changed features

### Plugin API

#### Almost all plugin events are now async

In Apollo Server 2, some [plugin events](./integrations/plugins-event-reference/) are synchronous (their return value is not a `Promise`), and some are "maybe-asynchronous" (they could return a `Promise` if they wanted, but didn't have to). This means that you can't do asynchronous work in the former events, and the typings for the latter events are somewhat complex.

In Apollo Server 3, _almost_ all plugin methods are always asynchronous: they always return a `Promise` type. This includes [end hooks](../integrations/plugins/#end-hooks) as well. The exceptions are `willResolveField` and its end hook and `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate`, which are always synchronous.

In practice, this means that all of your plugin events should use `async` functions or methods. If you are using TypeScript, you need to do this for your code to compile.

> In practice, Apollo Server generally uses `await` or `Promise.all` on values returned by plugin methods instead of an explicit `.then`. These constructs accept both `Promise`s and normal values. If you aren't using TypeScript, you might be able to get away with synchronous plugin methods for the time being.

#### `willSendResponse` is called more consistently

In Apollo Server 2, some errors related to [persisted queries](../performance/apq/) invoke the `requestDidStart` and `didEncounterError` plugin events _without_ invoking the `willSendResponse` event afterwards.

In Apollo Server 3, any request that makes it far enough to invoke `requestDidStart` also invokes `willSendResponse`. See [this PR](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/5287) for details.


#### Gateway interface renamed and simplified

In Apollo Server 2, the TypeScript type used for the `gateway` constructor option is called `GraphQLService`. In Apollo Server 3, it's called `GatewayInterface`. (For now, an identical interface named `GraphQLService` continues to be exported.)

This interface now requires the following:

* The `stop` method must be present.
* The `executor` method must async
* The `apollo` option must always be passed to the `load` method.

> All recent versions of `@apollo/gateway` satisfy these stronger requirements.

### Bad request errors more consistently return 4xx

In Apollo Server 2, certain poorly formatted requests receive HTTP responses with a 5xx status (indicating a server error) instead of 4xx (indicating a client error). For example, this occurs in some integrations for a missing POST body or a JSON parse error.

In Apollo Server 3, these errors are handled in a more consistent manner across integrations and consistently return HTTP responses with a 4xx status.

### Extensions (custom details) on `ApolloError`

#### Initializing an error

In Apollo Server 2, [error extensions](../data/errors/#including-custom-error-details) can be passed to the `ApolloError` constructor either as the third argument, *or* as an `extensions` option on the third argument.

In other words, these two lines are equivalent with Apollo Server 2:

```js
new ApolloError(message, code, {key: 'value'})
new ApolloError(message, code, {extensions: {key: 'value'}})
```

In Apollo Server 3, only the first line above is supported. If you try to use the second line, the constructor throws an error. Before upgrading, replace any code using the second form with the first form.

#### Reading error extensions

In Apollo Server 2, an error extension (`foo`) is present in two locations on an `ApolloError` object (`error`): `error.foo` _and_ `error.extensions.foo`. When that object is serialized for a JSON response, the extension is _also_ present in two locations in the JSON: `extensions.foo` and `extensions.exception.foo`.

In Apollo Server 3, an error extension is present in _one_ `ApolloError` location: `error.extensions.foo`. When the error is serialized to JSON, the extension is present only in `extensions.foo`.

See [this PR](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/5294) for more details.

### Mocking

In Apollo Server 2, the `mocks` and `mockEntireSchema` constructor options are essentially implemented as follows:

```javascript
import { addMockFunctionsToSchema } from 'graphql-tools';  // v4.x

const { mocks, mockEntireSchema } = constructorOptions;
const schemaWithMocks = addMockFunctionsToSchema({
  schema,
  mocks:
    typeof mocks === 'boolean' || typeof mocks === 'undefined'
      ? {} : mocks,
  preserveResolvers:
    typeof mockEntireSchema === 'undefined' ? false : !mockEntireSchema,
});
```

In Apollo Server 3, we've upgraded from `graphql-tools` v4 to `@graphql-tools/mock` v8. The details of how mocking works in GraphQL Tools has changed, and the name of the function that implements it has changed too. The new implementation is as follows:

```javascript
import { addMocksToSchema } from '@graphql-tools/mock';  // v8.x

const { mocks, mockEntireSchema } = constructorOptions;
const schemaWithMocks = addMocksToSchema({
  schema,
  mocks: mocks === true || typeof mocks === 'undefined' ? {} : mocks,
  preserveResolvers:
    typeof mockEntireSchema === 'undefined' ? false : !mockEntireSchema,
});
```

So the name of the function has changed, and additionally, the semantics of the function have changed. You can [read the GraphQL Tools migration docs](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/mocking/#migration-from-v7-and-below) to see if you use any mocking features that have changed between v4 and v8, and adjust the value of your `mocks` argument if so.

To use features of `addMocksToSchema` that require passing more options to it than the three that `ApolloServer` passes through, you can use the library directly. To do so, run `npm install @graphql-tools/mock @graphql-tools/schema` in your app, and replace

```javascript
new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers, mocks });
```

with

```javascript
import { addMocksToSchema } from '@graphql-tools/mock';
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';

new ApolloServer({
  schema: addMocksToSchema({
    schema: makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
    mocks: // ...
    // ...
  }),
});
```

Alternatively, to keep the current behavior without changing your mock functions at all, you can continue to use `graphql-tools` v4. To do this, run `npm install graphql-tools@v4.x` in your app, and replace

```javascript
new ApolloServer({typeDefs, resolvers, mocks, preserveResolvers});
```

with

```javascript
import { makeExecutableSchema, addMockFunctionsToSchema } from 'graphql-tools';

new ApolloServer({
  schema: addMockFunctionsToSchema({
    schema: makeExecutableSchema({typeDefs, resolvers}),
    mocks,
    preserveResolvers:
      typeof mockEntireSchema === 'undefined' ? false : !mockEntireSchema,
  }),
});
```

### `apollo-server-caching` test suite helpers

In Apollo Server 2, the `apollo-server-caching` package exports functions like `testKeyValueCache`, `testKeyValueCache_Basic`, and `testKeyValueCache_Expiration`, which define Jest test suites. The package also exports a `TestableKeyValueCache` type that's required for these test suites to be able to flush and close the cache.

You can use this to define Jest test suites for your own implementation of the `KeyValueCache` interface, although this requires intricate Jest and TypeScript config to set up.

In Apollo Server 3, these functions and type are removed. Instead, a `runKeyValueCacheTests` function is exported which can be run in any test suite (without any Jest-specific behavior). See the `apollo-server-caching` README for more details.

## Changes to framework integrations

### `start()` now mandatory for non-serverless framework integrations

Apollo Server v2.22 introduced the `server.start()` method for non-serverless framework integrations (Express, Fastify, Hapi, Koa, Micro, and Cloudflare). Users of these integrations were encouraged to await a call to it immediately after creating an `ApolloServer` object:

```javascript
async function startServer() {
  const server = new ApolloServer({...});
  await server.start();
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });
}
```

If any plugin `serverWillStart` events throw, or if the server fails to load its schema properly (for example, if the server is a gateway and cannot load its schema), then `await server.start()` will throw. This allows you to ensure that Apollo Server has successfully loaded its configuration before you start listening for HTTP requests.

In Apollo Server 2, calling this method was optional. If you didn't call it, you could still call methods like `applyMiddleware` and start listening. If a startup failure occurred, all GraphQL requests would fail.

In Apollo Server 3, you *must* `await server.start()` immediately after `new ApolloServer` before calling `applyMiddleware` (or `getMiddleware` or `getHandler`, depending on the integration). Note that you don't have to call it before calling the testing method `executeOperation`. Otherwise, that method will throw.

This does not apply to the batteries-included `apollo-server` package (the server is started as part of the async method `server.listen()`) or to serverless framework integrations.

### Peer deps instead of direct deps

In Apollo Server 2, the `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-koa`, and `apollo-server-micro` packages have *direct* dependencies on `express`, `koa`, and `micro` respectively, and `apollo-server-fastify` and `apollo-server-hapi` have no dependency on `fastify`, `hapi`, or `@hapi/hapi`.

In Apollo Server 3, these packages have *peer* dependencies on their corresponding framework packages. This means that you need to install a version of that package of your choice yourself in your app (though most likely that was already the case).

### CORS `*` is now the default

In Apollo Server 2, the default CORS configuration for most packages is to serve an `access-control-allow-origin: *` header for all responses.

However, this is not the case in Apollo Server 2 for `apollo-server-lambda`, `apollo-server-cloud-functions`, or `apollo-server-azure-functions` (these serve no CORS headers by default), or for `apollo-server-koa` (this serves an `access-control-allow-origin` header with a value matching the request's origin by default).

In Apollo Server 3, all implementations of `ApolloServer` that support CORS configuration have the same default of `access-control-allow-origin: *`.

To use your framework's Apollo Server 2 default CORS behavior in your Apollo Server 3 application, provide the options specified below to the `createHandler`/`getMiddleware` method.

#### Lambda / Cloud Functions

```js
server.createHandler({expressGetMiddlewareOptions: {cors: false}})
```

#### Azure Functions

```js
server.createHandler({cors: false})
```

#### Koa

```js
server.getMiddleware({cors: {}})
```

> `apollo-server-micro` and `apollo-server-cloudflare` do not support CORS configuration in Apollo Server 2 _or_ 3.

### `apollo-server-express`

In Apollo Server 2, `apollo-server-express` officially supports both the `express` framework and the older [`connect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect) framework.

In Apollo Server 3, we no longer guarantee future support for `connect`. We do still run a test suite against it and we will try not to _unintentionally_ break functionality under `connect`, but if future changes are easier to implement in an Express-only fashion, we reserve the right to break `connect` compatibility within Apollo Server 3.

### `apollo-server-lambda`

#### Now based on Express

In Apollo Server 2, `apollo-server-lambda` implements parsing AWS Lambda events and performing standard web framework logic inside the package itself. As Lambda added new capabilities, the logic had to adapt, and as Apollo Server added new features, they had to be implemented from scratch in `apollo-server-lambda`. Additionally, there was no way to add additional HTTP functionality (e.g., "middleware") to `apollo-server-lambda`.

In Apollo Server 3, `apollo-server-lambda` is implemented as a wrapper around `apollo-server-express`, using an [actively maintained package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vendia/serverless-express) to parse AWS Lambda events into Express requests. This simplifies the implementation and enables us to support new Lambda integrations such as Application Load Balancers. Additionally, because it now uses Express internally, you can extend HTTP functionality via Express middleware using the new `expressAppFromMiddleware` option to `createHandler`.

#### `createHandler` arguments changed

As part of the update described [above](#now-based-on-express), the arguments to `createHandler` have changed. Instead of taking only `cors` and `onHealthCheck`, the method takes an `expressGetMiddlewareOptions` option, which is an object that supports any of the options that the `apollo-server-express` `applyMiddleware` and `getMiddleware` can take (other than `app`).

For example, instead of:

```js
server.createHandler({onHealthCheck})
```

you now write

```js
server.createHandler({expressGetMiddlewareOptions: {onHealthCheck}})`
```

#### Handler is always async

In Apollo Server 2, the handler returned by `createHandler` can be called either as a function that takes a callback as a third argument, or (starting with Apollo Server v2.21.2) as an async function that returns a `Promise`.

In Apollo Server 3, the handler returned by `createHandler` is always an async function that returns a `Promise`. Any callback passed in will be ignored.

All currently supported Lambda runtimes support async handlers. However, if you are currently wrapping the handler returned from `createHandler` in your own larger handler and passing a callback into it, this no longer works. Rewrite your outer handler to be an async function and `await` the `Promise` returned from the handler returned by `createHandler`.

For example, if your server looked like this:

```javascript
const apolloHandler = server.createHandler();

exports.handler = function (event, context, callback) {
  doSomethingFirst();
  apolloHandler(event, context, (error, result) => {
    doSomethingLater();
    callback(error, result);
  });
}
```

you can change it to look like this:

```javascript
const apolloHandler = server.createHandler();

exports.handler = async function (event, context) {
  doSomethingFirst();
  try {
    return await apolloHandler(event, context);
  } finally {
    doSomethingLater();
  }
}
```

### `apollo-server-cloud-functions`

In Apollo Server 2, `apollo-server-cloud-functions` implements standard web framework logic inside the package itself. Even though the Node.js API for Google Cloud Functions provides its request and response in the form of Express request and response objects, Apollo Server 2 has a bespoke implementation unrelated to `apollo-server-express` and does not support all features supported by `apollo-server-express`. Additionally, there is no way to add additional HTTP functionality (e.g., "middleware") to `apollo-server-cloud-functions`.

In Apollo Server 3, `apollo-server-cloud-functions` is implemented on top of `apollo-server-express` and supports all features supported by `apollo-server-express`. You can add additional HTTP functionality via Express middleware using the new `expressAppFromMiddleware` option to `createHandler`.

As part of this, the arguments to `createHandler` have changed. Instead of taking only `cors`, it takes an `expressGetMiddlewareOptions` option, which is an object taking any of the options that the `apollo-server-express` `applyMiddleware` and `getMiddleware` can take (other than `app`). For example, instead of:

```js
server.createHandler({cors})
```

you now write:

```js
server.createHandler({expressGetMiddlewareOptions: {cors}})
```

### `apollo-server-fastify`

In Apollo Server 2, `apollo-server-fastify` supports Fastify v2 and does _not_ support Fastify v3. There is no dependency or peer dependency making this requirement clear.

In Apollo Server 3, `apollo-server-fastify` supports Fastify v3. It has not been tested with versions of Fastify older than v3. There is a peer dependency on `fastify` v3.

### `apollo-server-hapi`

We are not certain exactly which versions of Hapi are supported by `apollo-server-hapi` in Apollo Server 2. We _are_ certain that only `@hapi/hapi` v20.1.2 and higher are supported by Node 16, and Apollo Server 2 was not tested with versions of `hapi` newer than v17.8.5. (Hapi's package name changed from `hapi` to `@hapi/hapi` between v18.1.0 and v18.2.0.)

In Apollo Server 3, `apollo-server-hapi` works with `@hapi/hapi` v20.1.2 and Node 16. It is not tested with older versions of Hapi. Note that the Hapi project believes that [all versions older than v20 have security issues](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/4114).
