title: Implementing a subgraph with Apollo Server
---

This article demonstrates how to create a **subgraph** for a federated supergraph using Node.js and Apollo Server.

> To create a subgraph using a different language and/or framework, see the list of [Federation-compatible subgraph implementations](/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs/). Note that not all listed libraries support _all_ Federation features.

## Defining a subgraph

> To be part of a supergraph, a subgraph must conform to the [Apollo Federation subgraph specification](/federation/subgraph-spec/), which exposes the subgraph's capabilities to your graph router, as well as to tools like Apollo Studio.

Converting an existing monolithic graph into a single subgraph is a convenient first step in building a federated supergraph. To start, here's a _non-federated_ Apollo Server setup:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: '1', username: '@ava' };
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

// Note the top-level await!
const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);
console.log(`🚀  Server ready at ${url}`);
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

> Above, we wrap our schema in the `gql` tag from the `graphql-tag` package, converting our schema into an AST (i.e., `DocumentNode`). While Apollo Server can accept a `string` (or `DocumentNode`) for its `typeDefs`, the [`buildSubgraphSchema`](./api/apollo-subgraph/#buildsubgraphschema) function below requires the schema we pass in to be a `DocumentNode`.

This should look familiar if you've [set up Apollo Server](../getting-started/) before. If you haven't, we recommend you familiarize yourself with the basics before jumping into federation.

Now, let's convert this to a subgraph!

### 1. Install and import `@apollo/subgraph`

The first step is to install the `@apollo/subgraph` package in our server project:

```shell
npm install @apollo/subgraph
```

We also need to require the `buildSubgraphSchema` function from this package in in the file where we initialize `ApolloServer` (we'll use it later):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from '@apollo/subgraph'; //preserve-line
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### 2. Opt in to Federation 2

For a subgraph to use [new features in Federation 2](/federation/federation-2/new-in-federation-2/), its schema needs to include the following `extend schema` definition:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

const typeDefs = gql`
  # highlight-start
  extend schema
    @link(
      url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"
      import: ["@key", "@shareable"]
    )
  # highlight-end

  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

This definition enables the schema to use Federation 2 features. Without it, Federation 2 composition assumes that a subgraph is using Federation 1, which sets certain defaults for backward compatibility.

> As you begin using more [federation-specific directives](/federation/federated-types/federated-directives) beyond `@key` and `@shareable`, you'll need to add those directives to the `import` array shown above.

### 3. Define an entity

> Entities aren't _required_ in a subgraph, but they're a core building block of a federated supergraph, so it's good to get some practice defining them.

As part of our federated architecture, we want _other_ subgraphs to be able to contribute fields to the `User` type. To enable this, we add the `@key` directive to the `User` type's definition to designate it as an [entity](/federation/entities/):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
const typeDefs = gql`
  extend schema
    @link(
      url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"
      import: ["@key", "@shareable"]
    )

  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User
    @key(fields: "id") { # highlight-line
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

The `@key` directive tells the gateway which field(s) of the `User` entity can uniquely identify a particular instance of it. In this case, the gateway can use the single field `id`.

Next, we add a **reference resolver** for the `User` entity. A reference resolver tells the gateway how to fetch an entity by its `@key` fields:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: '1', username: '@ava' };
    },
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }) {
      return fetchUserById(user.id);
    },
  },
};
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

(This example requires defining the `fetchUserById` function to obtain the appropriate `User` from our backing data store.)

> [Learn more about entities.](/federation/entities/)

### 4. Generate the subgraph schema

Finally, we use the `buildSubgraphSchema` function from the `@apollo/subgraph` package to augment our schema definition with federation support. We provide the result of this function to the `ApolloServer` constructor:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
});

// Note the top level await!
const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);
console.log(`🚀  Server ready at ${url}`);
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

The server is now ready to act as a subgraph in a federated graph!

### Combined example

Here are the snippets above combined (again, note that for this sample to be complete, you must define the `fetchUserById` function for your data source):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from '@apollo/subgraph';

const typeDefs = gql`
  extend schema
    @link(
      url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"
      import: ["@key", "@shareable"]
    )

  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: '1', username: '@ava' };
    },
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }) {
      return fetchUserById(user.id);
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);
console.log(`🚀  Server ready at ${url}`);
```

</MultiCodeBlock>
