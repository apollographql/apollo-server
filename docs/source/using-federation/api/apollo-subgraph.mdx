title: 'API Reference: @apollo/subgraph'
api_reference: true
---

This API reference documents the exports from the `@apollo/subgraph` package. This package enables you to use Apollo Server as a subgraph in a federated supergraph. For more information, see [Implementing a subgraph with Apollo Server](../apollo-subgraph-setup).

> Note, we recommend using `@apollo/subgraph` with Apollo Server, but it is compatible with any GraphQL server built on `graphql-js`.

## `buildSubgraphSchema`

> This method was renamed from `buildFederatedSchema` after `@apollo/federation` v0.28.0 (the previous name still works, but it might be removed in a future release).

A function that takes a schema module object (or an array of them) and returns a federation-ready subgraph schema:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }), //highlight-line
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Used when [defining a subgraph](../apollo-subgraph-setup/#defining-a-subgraph) in a federated graph.

Each schema module is an object with the following format:

```ts
{
  typeDefs: DocumentNode,
  resolvers: ResolverMap
}
```

### Parameters

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `modules`

`Object` or `Array`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** A schema module object (or an array of them) with the structure shown above.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from '@apollo/subgraph';

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: '1', username: '@ava' };
    },
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }) {
      return fetchUserById(user.id);
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## `__resolveReference`

The name of a special **reference resolver** function you can define for every [entity](/federation/entities/) in a subgraph schema's resolver map.

The `__resolveReference` function enables your router's query planner to resolve a particular entity by whatever unique identifier your other subgraphs use to reference it. For details, see [Defining an entity](/federation/entities/#defining-an-entity).

The function takes the parameters listed below.

### Parameters

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

###### `reference`

`Object`

</td>
<td>

The representation of the entity that's passed from another subgraph.

This object includes a `__typename` field, along with whichever fields the subgraph uses for the entity's `@key`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `context`

`Object`

</td>
<td>

An object that's passed to every resolver that executes for a particular operation, enabling resolvers to share helpful context.

Within resolvers and plugins, this object is named `contextValue`. For details, see [The `context` argument](../../data/context#the-contextvalue-object).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `info`

`Object`

</td>
<td>

Contains information about the operation's execution state, including the field name, the path to the field from the root, and more.

This object's core fields are listed in the [GraphQL.js source code](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/a24a9f35b876bdd0d5050eca34d3020bd0db9a29/src/type/definition.ts#L891-L902).

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const typeDefs = gql`
  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { dataSources }) {
      // user will always have at least the `id` and the `__typename` here
      return dataSources.users.fetchUserById(user.id);
    },
  },
};
```
