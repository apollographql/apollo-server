title: Apollo Server 4 (Alpha)
---

> 📣 **Apollo Server 4 is out in public [alpha](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/release-stages).** This alpha primarily aims to enable community members to develop integrations between Apollo Server and their favorite web frameworks.
>
> [See what's new](./migration/)!
>
> We are working on updating our documentation to reflect the changes introduced in Apollo Server 4.  In this effort, we have temporarily omitted articles from this branch that aren't yet up to date.  In the meantime, you can reference the [Apollo Server 3](/apollo-server) docs for in-depth information on Apollo Server's features.

**Apollo Server is an [open-source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), spec-compliant GraphQL server** that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](/react). It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

#### You can use Apollo Server as:

* The gateway for a [federated supergraph](/federation/)
* The GraphQL server for a [subgraph](/federation/subgraphs) in a federated supergraph
<!-- TODO(AS4): replace links to new articles once they exist -->
* A [stand-alone GraphQL server](./migration#migrating-from-apollo-server)
* An add-on to your application's existing Node.js middleware (such as Express, AWS Lambda, or Fastify)

#### Apollo Server provides:

*  **Straightforward setup**, so your client developers can start fetching data quickly
*  **Incremental adoption**, enabling you to add features as they're needed
*  **Universal compatibility** with any data source, any build tool, and any GraphQL client
*  **Production readiness**, enabling you to confidently run your graph in production
