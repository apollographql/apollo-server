> **Apollo Server 3 is currently available as a release candidate. To install the current release candidate, specify `@rc` after the name of the Apollo Server package you are installing; for example, `npm install apollo-server@rc`.**

**Apollo Server is an [open-source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), spec-compliant GraphQL server** that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react). It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.
