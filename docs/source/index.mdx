title: Introduction to Apollo Server
---

**Apollo Server is an [open-source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), spec-compliant GraphQL server** that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react). It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

#### You can use Apollo Server as:

* A gateway for a [federated supergraph](/federation/)
  * The GraphQL server for a [subgraph](/federation/subgraphs) within a federated supergraph
* A stand-alone GraphQL server, including in a serverless environment
* An add-on to your application's existing [Node.js middleware](./integrations/middleware/) (such as Express or Fastify)

#### Apollo Server provides:

*  **Straightforward setup**, so your client developers can start fetching data quickly
*  **Incremental adoption**, allowing you to add features as they're needed
*  **Universal compatibility** with any data source, any build tool, and any GraphQL client
*  **Production readiness**, enabling you to ship features faster
