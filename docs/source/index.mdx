**Apollo Server is an [open-source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), spec-compliant GraphQL server** that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](/react). It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.
