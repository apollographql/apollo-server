> ðŸ“£ **Apollo Server 5 is generally available!**
>
> Apollo Server 5 is a small upgrade focused largely on adjusting which dependency versions are supported. [Upgrading from v4 to v5](/apollo-server/migration/) usually only takes a few minutes. Because the behavior of Apollo Server has changed minimally between v4 and v5, these docs document both versions.
>
> Still on Apollo Server 3? AS3 has been end-of-life since October 2024. We've got a [full migration guide for upgrading directly from v3 to v5](/apollo-server/migration-from-v3/). Docs for v3 are [available here](/apollo-server/v3/).

**Apollo Server is an [open-source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), spec-compliant GraphQL server** that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](/react). It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.
