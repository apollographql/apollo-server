**Apollo Server is an [open-source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), spec-compliant GraphQL server** that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react). It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

#### You can use Apollo Server as:

* The gateway for a [federated supergraph](/federation/)
* The GraphQL server for a [subgraph](/federation/subgraphs) in a federated supergraph
<!-- TODO: replace links to better related pages -->
* A [stand-alone GraphQL server](/migration#startstandaloneserver)
* An add-on to your application's existing Node.js middleware (such as Express, AWS Lambda, or Fastify)

#### Apollo Server provides:

*  **Straightforward setup**, so your client developers can start fetching data quickly
*  **Incremental adoption**, enabling you to add features as they're needed
*  **Universal compatibility** with any data source, any build tool, and any GraphQL client
*  **Production readiness**, enabling you to confidently run your graph in production
