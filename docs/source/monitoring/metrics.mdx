> Sending metrics from Apollo Server to GraphOS requires an [Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing).
> If your organization doesn't have an Enterprise plan, you can test out this functionality by signing up for a free [GraphOS trial](https://studio.apollographql.com/signup?referrer=docs-content).

Apollo Server integrates seamlessly with [Apollo GraphOS](/graphos/) to help you monitor the execution of your GraphQL operations. Apollo Server additionally provides configurable mechanisms for logging each phase of a GraphQL operation.

> Using Federation? Check out the documentation for [federated tracing](/federation/metrics/).

## Sending metrics to GraphOS

[Apollo GraphOS](/graphos/) provides an integrated hub for all of your GraphQL performance data, which you can view in Apollo Studio. Studio [aggregates and displays information](/graphos/metrics/) for your schema, queries, requests, and errors. You can also configure alerts that support [Slack](/graphos/metrics/notifications/performance-alerts#slack) and [Datadog](/graphos/metrics/datadog-integration) integrations.

### Connecting to GraphOS

To connect Apollo Server to GraphOS, first [obtain a graph API key](/graphos/api-keys#graph-api-keys). To provide this key to Apollo Server, assign it to the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable in your server's environment.

Then associate your server instance with a particular graph ID and [graph variant](/graphos/graphs/#variants) by setting the `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variable.

You can set environment variable values on the command line as seen below, or with the [`dotenv` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (or similar).

```bash
# Replace the example values below with values specific to your use case.
# This example associates your server with the `my-variant` variant of
# the `my-graph` graph.
$ APOLLO_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=my-graph@my-variant \
  node start-server.js
```

#### Communicating with Studio

By default, Apollo Server aggregates your traces and sends them in batches to Studio every minute. This behavior is highly configurable, and you can change the parameters in the [Usage Reporting plugin's configuration](../api/plugin/usage-reporting/#custom-installation).

### Identifying distinct clients

Apollo Studio's [client awareness feature](/graphos/metrics/client-awareness/) enables you to view metrics for distinct versions
of your clients. To enable this, your clients need to include some or all of the following identifying information in the headers of GraphQL requests they
send to Apollo Server:

| Identifier | Header Name (default) | Example Value |
|----|----|----|
| Client name | `apollographql-client-name` | `iOS Native` |
| Client version | `apollographql-client-version` | `1.0.1` |

Each of these fields can have any string value that's useful for your application. To simplify the browsing and sorting of your client data in Studio, a three-part version number (such as `1.0.1`) is recommended for client versions.

> Client version is **not** tied to your current version of Apollo Client (or any other client library). You define this value and are responsible for updating it whenever meaningful changes are made to your client.

#### Setting client awareness headers in Apollo Client

If you're using Apollo Client, you can set default values for client name and
version in the [`ApolloClient` constructor](/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#the-apolloclient-constructor). All requests to Apollo Server will automatically include these values in the appropriate headers.

#### Using custom headers

For more advanced cases, or to use headers other than the default headers, pass a `generateClientInfo` function into the [usage reporting plugin](../api/plugin/usage-reporting/):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting } from '@apollo/server/plugin/usageReporting';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    //highlight-start
    ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting({
      generateClientInfo: ({
        request
      }) => {
        const headers = request.http && request.http.headers;
        if(headers) {
          return {
            clientName: headers["apollographql-client-name"],
            clientVersion: headers["apollographql-client-version"],
          };
        } else {
          return {
            clientName: "Unknown Client",
            clientVersion: "Unversioned",
          };
        }
      },
    })
  ],
  //highlight-end
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);

console.log(`ðŸš€ Server listening at: ${url}`);
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Logging

You can set up fine-grained operation logging in Apollo Server by defining a custom **plugin**. Apollo Server plugins enable you to perform actions in response to individual phases of the GraphQL request lifecycle, such as whenever a GraphQL request is received from a client.

The example below defines a plugin that responds to three different operation events. As it shows, you provide an array of your defined `plugins` to the `ApolloServer` constructor.

For a list of available lifecycle events and their descriptions, see [Plugins](../integrations/plugins/).

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const myPlugin = {
  // Fires whenever a GraphQL request is received from a client.
  async requestDidStart(requestContext) {
    console.log('Request started! Query:\n' + requestContext.request.query);

    return {
      // Fires whenever Apollo Server will parse a GraphQL
      // request to create its associated document AST.
      async parsingDidStart(requestContext) {
        console.log('Parsing started!');
      },

      // Fires whenever Apollo Server will validate a
      // request's document AST against your GraphQL schema.
      async validationDidStart(requestContext) {
        console.log('Validation started!');
      },
    };
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [myPlugin],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>
