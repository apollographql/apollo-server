> This tutorial walks you through installing and configuring Apollo Server.
> If you're just getting started with GraphQL or the Apollo
> platform, we recommend first completing the [full-stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/).

This tutorial helps you:

* Obtain a basic understanding of GraphQL principles
* Define a GraphQL **schema** that represents the structure of your data set
* Run an instance of Apollo Server that lets you execute queries against your schema

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the command line and
JavaScript, and that you have a recent version of Node.js (8+) installed.

## Step 1: Create a new project

1. From your preferred development directory, create a directory for a new project
and `cd` into it:

  ```bash
  mkdir graphql-server-example
  cd graphql-server-example
  ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm` (or another package manager you
prefer, such as Yarn):

  ```bash
  npm init --yes
  ```

Your project directory now contains a `package.json` file.

## Step 2: Install dependencies

Applications that run Apollo Server require two top-level dependencies:

* [`apollo-server`](https://npm.im/apollo-server) is the core library for Apollo Server itself, which helps you define the shape of your data and how to fetch it.
* [`graphql`](https://npm.im/graphql) is the library used to build a GraphQL schema and execute queries against it.

Run the following command to install both of these dependencies and save them in
your project's `node_modules` directory:

```bash
npm install apollo-server graphql
```

Also create an empty `index.js` file in your project's root directory:

```bash
touch index.js
```

 To keep things
simple, `index.js` will contain **all** of the code for this example application.

## Step 3: Define your GraphQL schema

Every GraphQL server (including Apollo Server) uses a **schema**
to define the structure of data that clients can query.
In this example, we'll create a server for querying a collection
of books by title and author.

Open `index.js` in your preferred editor and paste the following into it:

```js:title=index.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

// A schema is a collection of type definitions (hence "typeDefs")
// that together define the "shape" of queries that are executed against
// your data.
const typeDefs = gql`
  # Comments in GraphQL strings (such as this one) start with the hash (#) symbol.

  # This "Book" type defines the queryable fields for every book in our data source.
  type Book {
    title: String
    author: String
  }

  # The "Query" type is special: it lists all of the available queries that
  # clients can execute, along with the return type for each. In this
  # case, the "books" query returns an array of zero or more Books (defined above).
  type Query {
    books: [Book]
  }
`;
```

This snippet defines a simple, valid GraphQL schema. Clients will be able to execute
a query named `books`, and our server will return an array of zero or more `Book`s.

## Step 4: Define your data set

Now that we've defined the _structure_ of our data, we can define the data itself.
Apollo Server can fetch data from any source you connect to (including
a database, a REST API, a static object storage service, or even another GraphQL
server). For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll just hardcode some example data.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.js`:

```js:title=index.js
const books = [
  {
    title: 'The Awakening',
    author: 'Kate Chopin',
  },
  {
    title: 'City of Glass',
    author: 'Paul Auster',
  },
];
```

This snippet defines a simple data set that clients can query. Notice that the two
objects in the array each match the structure of the `Book` type we defined in our schema.

## Step 5: Define a resolver

We've defined our data set, but Apollo Server doesn't know that it should
 _use_ that data set when it's executing a query. To fix this, we create a
 **resolver**.

Resolvers tell Apollo Server _how_ to fetch the data associated with a particular
type. Because our `Book` array is hardcoded, the corresponding resolver is
straightforward.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.js`:

```js:title=index.js
// Resolvers define the technique for fetching the types defined in the
// schema. This resolver retrieves books from the "books" array above.
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
  },
};
```

## Step 6: Create an instance of `ApolloServer`

We've defined our schema, data set, and resolver. Now we just need to provide
this information to Apollo Server when we initialize it.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.js`:

```js:title=index.js
// The ApolloServer constructor requires two parameters: your schema
// definition and your set of resolvers.
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

// The `listen` method launches a web server.
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

## Step 7: Start the server

We're ready to start our server! Run the following from your project's root
directory:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the following output:

```
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
```

We're up and running!

## Step 8: Execute your first query

We can now execute GraphQL queries on our server. To execute our first query,
we can use a tool called **GraphQL Playground**.

<ExpansionPanel title="ðŸ“£ The Apollo Studio Explorer now supports local servers">

Apollo Studio now supports **dev graphs**, which are user-specific graphs that represent your local development server. Dev graphs enable you to query your locally running server with Studio's powerful Explorer.

To try out dev graphs:

1. Make sure your server is running locally.
2. Visit [studio.apollographql.com/dev](https://studio.apollographql.com/dev).
3. Create a (free) Apollo account if you don't have one. Then specify a name, endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`), and organization for your dev graph.
4. Try running operations on your local server using the [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/).

</ExpansionPanel>

With your server still running, visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to open GraphQL Playground. (Apollo Server hosts GraphQL Playground automatically when you run it in a non-production environment.)

![GraphQL Playground](./images/getting-started/graphql-playground.png)

The GraphQL Playground UI includes:

* A text area (to the left) for writing queries
* A Play button (the triangle button in the middle) for executing queries
* A text area (to the right) for viewing query results
* Views for schema inspection and generated documentation (via tabs on the right side)

Our server supports a single query named `books`. Let's execute it!

Here's a GraphQL **query string** for executing the `books` query:

```graphql
{
  books {
    title
    author
  }
}
```

Paste this string into the left text area and click the Play button. The
results (from our hardcoded data set) appear on the right:

![The response from our server shows title and author!](./images/getting-started/graphql-playground-response.png)

One of the most important concepts of GraphQL is that clients can choose to query
_only for the fields they need_. Delete `author` from the query string and execute
it again. The response updates to include only the `title` field for each book!

> **Note:** If your server is deployed to an environment where `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, GraphQL Playground and introspection are **disabled** by default. To enable them, set `playground: true` and `introspection: true` in [the options to `ApolloServer`'s constructor](./api/apollo-server/#constructor).
