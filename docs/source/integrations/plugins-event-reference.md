title: Apollo Server plugin event reference
---

> All plugin lifecycle methods are `async`, _except for [`willResolveField`](#willresolvefield) and [`schemaDidLoadOrUpdate`](#schemadidloadorupdate)_.

This reference describes the lifecycle events that your [custom Apollo Server plugin](./plugins/) can respond to.

Apollo Server fires two types of events that plugins can hook into: **server lifecycle
events** and **request lifecycle events**.

* Server lifecycle events are high-level events related to the lifecycle of Apollo Server itself (e.g., [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart)).
* Request lifecycle events are associated with the lifecycle of a specific request.
  * You define responses to these events _within_ the response to a `requestDidStart` event, as described in [Responding to request lifecycle events](./plugins#responding-to-request-lifecycle-events).

> With two exceptions, all plugin methods in Apollo Server 4 are `async`. The first exception is `willResolveField`, which is called much more frequently than other plugin methods. The second exception is `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate`, where making the method `async` would introduce unclear ordering semantics around method executions.

## Server lifecycle events

### `serverWillStart`

The `serverWillStart` event fires when Apollo Server is preparing to start serving GraphQL requests. The server doesn't start until this asynchronous method completes. If it throws (i.e., if the `Promise` it returns is _rejected_), startup _fails_ and your server does not serve GraphQL operations. This helps you make sure all of your server's dependencies are available before attempting to begin serving requests.

<!-- TODO(AS4) add link to integration page when exists -->
This event is fired at different times depending on which Apollo Server integration you're using:

* If you are using `startStandaloneServer`, it's fired when you invoke the `startStandaloneServer` function with your server instance.
* In non-serverless integrations like `expressMiddleware`, it's fired from the `start()` method.
* In serverless integrations, it's usually fired in response to the first incoming request.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        console.log('Server starting!');
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `drainServer`

The `drainServer` event fires when Apollo Server is starting to shut down because [`ApolloServer.stop()`](../api/apollo-server/#stop) has been invoked (either explicitly by your code, or by one of the [termination signal handlers](../api/apollo-server/#stoponterminationsignals)). While `drainServer` handlers run, GraphQL operations can still execute successfully. This hook is designed to allow you to stop accepting new connections and close existing connections. Apollo Server has a [built-in plugin](../api/plugin/drain-http-server) which uses this event to drain a [Node `http.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server).

You define your `drainServer` handler in the object returned by your [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart) handler, because the two handlers usually interact with the same data. Currently, `drainServer` handlers do not take arguments (this might change in the future).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async drainServer() {
            await myCustomServer.drain();
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `serverWillStop`

The `serverWillStop` event fires when Apollo Server is starting to shut down because [`ApolloServer.stop()`](../api/apollo-server/#stop) has been invoked (either explicitly by your code, or by one of the [termination signal handlers](../api/apollo-server/#stoponterminationsignals)). If your plugin is running any background tasks, this is a good place to shut them down.

You define your `serverWillStop` handler in the object returned by your [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart) handler, because the two handlers usually interact with the same data. Currently, `serverWillStop` handlers do not take arguments (this might change in the future).

When your `serverWillStop` handler is called, Apollo Server is in a state where it will no longer start to execute new GraphQL operations, so it's a good place to flush observability data. If you are looking for a hook that runs while operations can still execute, try [`drainServer`](#drainserver).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        const interval = setInterval(doSomethingPeriodically, 1000);
        return {
          async serverWillStop() {
            clearInterval(interval);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `renderLandingPage`

This event enables you to serve a [custom landing page](../workflow/build-run-queries/#custom-landing-page) from Apollo Server's base URL. The event is fired once by Apollo Server after all `serverWillStart` events run. **At most one installed plugin can define a `renderLandingPage` handler.** Otherwise, Apollo Server throws an error on startup.

You define your plugin's `renderLandingPage` handler in the object returned by your [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart) handler, which enables it to read values passed to `serverWillStart`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async renderLandingPage() {
            const html = `
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                    <head>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
                    </body>
                </html>`;
            return { html };
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

The handler should return an object with a string `html` field. The value of that field is served as HTML for any requests with `accept: text/html` headers.

For more landing page options, see [Changing the landing page](../workflow/build-run-queries/#changing-the-landing-page).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

   plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async renderLandingPage() {
            return { html: `<html><body>Welcome to your server!</body></html>` };
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>


### `requestDidStart`

> **New in Apollo Server 4**: In Apollo Server 4, `requestDidStart` hooks are called in parallel rather than in series.

The `requestDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server begins fulfilling a GraphQL request.

```ts
requestDidStart?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'request' | 'context' | 'logger'
  >
): Promise<GraphQLRequestListener<TContext> | void>;
```

This function can optionally return an object that includes functions for responding
to request lifecycle events that might follow `requestDidStart`.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async requestDidStart(requestContext) {
        // Within this returned object, define functions that respond
        // to request-specific lifecycle events.
        return {
          // The `parsingDidStart` request lifecycle event fires
          // when parsing begins. The event is scoped within an
          // associated `requestDidStart` server lifecycle event.
          async parsingDidStart(requestContext) {
            console.log('Parsing started!')
          },
        }
      }
    }
  ],
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

If your plugin doesn't need to respond to any request lifecycle events, `requestDidStart`
should not return a value.

### `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate`

The `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate` event fires whenever Apollo Server initially loads the schema or updates the schema. 

A `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate` handler is given the new API schema and optionally the new core schema (if using a gateway). If you provide a gateway and it is older than `@apollo/gateway@0.35.0`, attempting to register a `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate` handler will fail.

`schemaDidLoadOrUpdate` is a synchronous plugin API (i.e., it does not return a `Promise`).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          schemaDidLoadOrUpdate({ apiSchema, coreSupergraphSdl }) {
            console.log(`The API schema is ${printSchema(apiSchema)}`);
            if (coreSupergraphSdl) {
              console.log(`The core schema is ${coreSupergraphSdl}`);
            }
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Request lifecycle events

> If you're using TypeScript to create your plugin, implement the [ `GraphQLRequestListener` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/93ebfc742fb201f885227474836ebdeaa4ab0691/packages/server/src/externalTypes/plugins.ts#L104) to define functions for request lifecycle events.

When Apollo Server processes a request, these events fire in the order listed (with the exception of `didEncounterErrors`, which might fire in one of a few places depending on when errors occur). [See the flow diagram](./plugins/#request-lifecycle-event-flow)

Note that not every event fires for every request (for example, `parsingDidStart` doesn't fire for an operation that Apollo Server has cached and doesn't need to parse again).

### `didResolveSource`

The `didResolveSource` event is invoked after Apollo Server has determined the
`String`-representation of the incoming operation that it will act upon.  In the
event that this `String` was not directly passed in from the client, this
may be retrieved from a cache store (e.g., Automated Persisted Queries).

At this stage, there is not a guarantee that the operation is not malformed.

```ts
didResolveSource?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>, 'source' | 'logger'>,
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `parsingDidStart`

The `parsingDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server will parse a GraphQL
request to create its associated `document` AST.

If Apollo Server receives a request with a query string that matches a _previous_
request, the associated `document` might already be available in Apollo Server's cache.
In this case, `parsingDidStart` is _not_ called for the request, because parsing
does not occur.

```ts
parsingDidStart?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'metrics' | 'source' | 'logger'
  >,
): Promise<void | (err?: Error) => Promise<void>>;
```

### `validationDidStart`

The `validationDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server will validate a
request's `document` AST against your GraphQL schema.

Like `parsingDidStart`, this event does _not_ fire if a request's `document` is
already available in Apollo Server's cache (only successfully validated `document`s are cached by Apollo Server).

The `document` AST is guaranteed to be
available at this stage, because parsing must succeed for validation to occur.

```ts
validationDidStart?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'metrics' | 'source' | 'document' | 'logger'
  >,
): Promise<void | (err?: ReadonlyArray<Error>) => Promise<void>>;
```

### `didResolveOperation`

The `didResolveOperation` event fires after the `graphql` library successfully
determines the operation to execute from a request's `document` AST. At this stage,
both the `operationName` string and `operation` AST are available.

This event is _not_ associated with your GraphQL server's _resolvers_. When this event fires, your resolvers have not yet executed (they execute after [`executionDidStart`](#executiondidstart)).

> If the operation is anonymous (i.e., the operation is `query { ... }` instead of `query NamedQuery { ... }`), then `operationName` is `null`.

```ts
didResolveOperation?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'metrics' | 'source' | 'document' | 'operationName' | 'operation' | 'logger'
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `responseForOperation`

The `responseForOperation` event is fired immediately before GraphQL execution
would take place. If its return value resolves to a non-null `GraphQLResponse`,
that result is used instead of executing the query. Hooks from different plugins
are invoked in series, and the first non-null response is used.

```ts
responseForOperation?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'metrics' | 'source' | 'document' | 'operationName' | 'operation' | 'logger'
  >,
): Promise<GraphQLResponse | null>;
```

### `executionDidStart`

The `executionDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server begins executing the
GraphQL operation specified by a request's `document` AST.

```ts
executionDidStart?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'metrics' | 'source' | 'document' | 'operationName' | 'operation' | 'logger'
  >,
): Promise<GraphQLRequestExecutionListener | void>;
```

`executionDidStart` may return an object with one or both of the methods `executionDidEnd` and `willResolveField`.  `executionDidEnd` is treated like an end hook: it is called after execution with any errors that occurred. `willResolveField` is documented in the next section.
### `willResolveField`

The `willResolveField` event fires whenever Apollo Server is about to resolve a single field during the execution of an operation. The handler is passed an object with four fields (`source`, `args`, `contextValue`, and `info`) that correspond to the [four positional arguments passed to resolvers](../data/resolvers/#resolver-arguments). Note that `source` corresponds to the argument often called `parent` in our docs.

You provide your `willResolveField` handler in the object returned by your [`executionDidStart`](#executiondidstart) handler.

Your `willResolveField` handler can optionally return an ["end hook"](./plugins/#end-hooks) function that's invoked with the resolver's result (or the error that it throws). The end hook is called when your resolver has _fully_ resolved (e.g., if the resolver returns a Promise, the hook is called with the Promise's eventual resolved result).

`willResolveField` and its end hook are synchronous plugin APIs (i.e., they do not return `Promise`s).

`willResolveField` only fires when a field is resolved inside the Apollo Server itself; it does not fire at all if the server is a Gateway.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async requestDidStart(initialRequestContext) {
        return {
          async executionDidStart(executionRequestContext) {
            return {
              willResolveField({source, args, contextValue, info}) {
                const start = process.hrtime.bigint();
                return (error, result) => {
                  const end = process.hrtime.bigint();
                  console.log(`Field ${info.parentType.name}.${info.fieldName} took ${end - start}ns`);
                  if (error) {
                    console.log(`It failed with ${error}`);
                  } else {
                    console.log(`It returned ${result}`);
                  }
                };
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `didEncounterErrors`

The `didEncounterErrors` event fires when Apollo Server encounters errors while
parsing, validating, or executing a GraphQL operation.

```ts
didEncounterErrors?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'metrics' | 'source' | 'errors' | 'logger'
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `willSendResponse`

The `willSendResponse` event fires whenever Apollo Server is about to send a response
for a GraphQL operation. This event fires (and Apollo Server sends a response) even
if the GraphQL operation encounters one or more errors.

```ts
willSendResponse?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'metrics' | 'response' | 'logger'
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```
