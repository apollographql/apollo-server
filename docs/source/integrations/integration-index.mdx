Apollo Server 4 includes two built-in integrations: [`startStandaloneServer`](../api/standalone) and [`expressMiddleware`](../api/express-middleware).

The `startStandaloneServer` function sets useful defaults to get you started quickly. Under the hood, the `startStandaloneServer` function uses Apollo Server 4's Express integration (i.e., `expressMiddleware`). The `expressMiddleware` function is Apollo Server 4's [Express](https://expressjs.com/) integration.

> Have you built, or are you maintaining, an Apollo Server integration that isn't listed here? Please [submit a PR](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/docs/source/integrations/integration-index.mdx) to be added to this list!

The larger community maintains the following open-source integrations for Apollo Server:

> Apollo does not provide official support for the above community-maintained libraries. We cannot guarantee that community-maintained libraries adhere to best practices or that they will continue to be maintained.

For those _building_ a new integration library,  we'd like to welcome you (and your repository!) to the [`apollo-server-integrations`](https://github.com/apollo-server-integrations) Github organization alongside other community-maintained Apollo Server integrations. If you participate in our organization, you'll have the option to publish under our community's NPM scope `@as-integrations`, ensuring your integration is discoverable.
