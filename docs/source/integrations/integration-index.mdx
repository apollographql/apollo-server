title: Apollo Server Integrations
---

Apollo Server 4 includes two built-in integrations: [`startStandaloneServer`](../api/standalone) and [`expressMiddleware`](../api/express-middleware).

The `startStandaloneServer` function sets useful defaults to get you started quickly. Under the hood, the `startStandaloneServer` function uses Apollo Server 4's Express integration (i.e., `expressMiddleware`). The `expressMiddleware` function is Apollo Server 4's [Express](https://expressjs.com/) integration.

> Are you looking to build a new integration? Or help maintain an existing integration? See [Building Web Framework Integrations for Apollo Server](./building-integrations) for step-by-step guidance!

Apollo and the larger community maintain the following open-source integrations for Apollo Server:
