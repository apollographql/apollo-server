title: Apollo Server Integrations
---

Apollo Server 4 includes two built-in integrations: [`startStandaloneServer`](../api/standalone) and [`expressMiddleware`](../api/express-middleware).

The `startStandaloneServer` function sets useful defaults to get you started quickly. Under the hood, the `startStandaloneServer` function uses Apollo Server 4's Express integration (i.e., `expressMiddleware`). The `expressMiddleware` function is Apollo Server 4's [Express](https://expressjs.com/) integration.

Apollo does not provide official support for the above community-maintained libraries. We cannot guarantee that community-maintained libraries adhere to best practices, or that they will continue to be maintained.

For those _building_ a new integration library, we recommend that your repository lives within Apollo's [`apollo-server-integrations`](https://github.com/apollo-server-integrations) Github organization alongside other Apollo Server integrations. If you are _publishing_ a new integration package, we recommend publishing under the `@as-integrations` scope to ensure your integration is discoverable for other Apollo Server users.
