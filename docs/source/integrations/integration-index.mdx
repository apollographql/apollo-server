Apollo Server 4's [`startStandaloneServer`](../api/standalone) function spins up a basic web server with sensible defaults.  The server is a fully functional GraphQL server supporting all of Apollo Server's GraphQL-level customizations, but it offers minimal opportunities for HTTP-level configuration.

If you need more control over how your GraphQL server speaks HTTP, you should instead use an _integration_. Integrations are packages which connect the Apollo Server API to your favorite web framework.

Apollo maintains an [integration](../api/express-middleware) between Apollo Server and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), the most popular Node.js web framework. The integration with Express v4 is published as [`@as-integrations/express4`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@as-integrations/express), and the integration with Express v5 is published as [`@as-integrations/express5`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@as-integrations/express5). Both packages export the function [`expressMiddleware`](../api/express-middleware).

> The Express v4 integration is also included in the main `@apollo/server` package, exported from `@apollo/server/express4`. Its behavior is identical to the `@as-integrations/express4`. Express v5 is only supported by the external package. (A future major version of Apollo Server will remove `@apollo/server/express4`.)

> Have you built, or are you maintaining, an Apollo Server integration that isn't listed here? Please [submit a PR](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/docs/source/integrations/integration-index.mdx) to be added to this list!

The larger community maintains the following open-source integrations for Apollo Server:

> Apollo does not provide official support for the above community-maintained libraries. We cannot guarantee that community-maintained libraries adhere to best practices or that they will continue to be maintained.

For those _building_ a new integration library,  we'd like to welcome you (and your repository!) to the [`apollo-server-integrations`](https://github.com/apollo-server-integrations) Github organization alongside other community-maintained Apollo Server integrations. If you participate in our organization, you'll have the option to publish under our community's NPM scope `@as-integrations`, ensuring your integration is discoverable.
