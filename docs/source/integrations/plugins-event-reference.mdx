title: Apollo Server Plugin Event Reference
---

> All plugin lifecycle methods are `async`, _except for [`willResolveField`](#willresolvefield) and [`schemaDidLoadOrUpdate`](#schemadidloadorupdate)_.

This reference describes the lifecycle events that your [custom Apollo Server plugin](./plugins/) can respond to.

Apollo Server fires two types of events that plugins can hook into: **server lifecycle
events** and **request lifecycle events**.

* Server lifecycle events are high-level events related to the lifecycle of Apollo Server itself (e.g., [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart)).
* Request lifecycle events are associated with the lifecycle of a specific request.
  * You define responses to these events _within_ the response to a `requestDidStart` event, as described in [Responding to request lifecycle events](./plugins#responding-to-request-lifecycle-events).

> With two exceptions, all plugin methods in Apollo Server are `async`. The first exception is `willResolveField`, which is called much more frequently than other plugin methods. The second exception is `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate`, where making the method `async` would introduce unclear ordering semantics around method executions.

## Server lifecycle events

### `serverWillStart`

The `serverWillStart` event fires when Apollo Server is preparing to start serving GraphQL requests. The server doesn't start until this asynchronous method completes. If it throws (i.e., if the `Promise` it returns is _rejected_), startup _fails_ and your server does not serve GraphQL operations. This helps you make sure all of your server's dependencies are available before attempting to begin serving requests.

This event is fired at different times depending on which [Apollo Server integration](./integration-index) you're using:

* If you are using `startStandaloneServer`, it's fired when you invoke the `startStandaloneServer` function with your server instance.
* In non-serverless integrations like `expressMiddleware`, it's fired from the `start()` method.
* In serverless integrations, it's usually fired in response to the first incoming request.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        console.log('Server starting!');
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `drainServer`

The `drainServer` event fires when Apollo Server is starting to shut down because [`ApolloServer.stop()`](../api/apollo-server/#stop) has been invoked (either explicitly by your code, or by one of the [termination signal handlers](../api/apollo-server/#stoponterminationsignals)). While `drainServer` handlers run, GraphQL operations can still execute successfully. This hook is designed to allow you to stop accepting new connections and close existing connections. Apollo Server has a [built-in plugin](../api/plugin/drain-http-server) which uses this event to drain a [Node `http.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server).

You define your `drainServer` handler in the object returned by your [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart) handler, because the two handlers usually interact with the same data. Currently, `drainServer` handlers do not take arguments (this might change in the future).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async drainServer() {
            await myCustomServer.drain();
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `serverWillStop`

The `serverWillStop` event fires when Apollo Server is starting to shut down because [`ApolloServer.stop()`](../api/apollo-server/#stop) has been invoked (either explicitly by your code, or by one of the [termination signal handlers](../api/apollo-server/#stoponterminationsignals)). If your plugin is running any background tasks, this is a good place to shut them down.

You define your `serverWillStop` handler in the object returned by your [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart) handler, because the two handlers usually interact with the same data. Currently, `serverWillStop` handlers do not take arguments (this might change in the future).

When your `serverWillStop` handler is called, Apollo Server is in a state where it will no longer start to execute new GraphQL operations, so it's a good place to flush observability data. If you are looking for a hook that runs while operations can still execute, try [`drainServer`](#drainserver).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        const interval = setInterval(doSomethingPeriodically, 1000);
        return {
          async serverWillStop() {
            clearInterval(interval);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `renderLandingPage`

This event enables you to serve a [custom landing page](../workflow/build-run-queries/#custom-landing-page) from Apollo Server's base URL. The event is fired once by Apollo Server after all `serverWillStart` events run. **At most one installed plugin can define a `renderLandingPage` handler.** Otherwise, Apollo Server throws an error on startup.

You define your plugin's `renderLandingPage` handler in the object returned by your [`serverWillStart`](#serverwillstart) handler, which enables it to read values passed to `serverWillStart`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts title="index.ts"
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          //highlight-start
          async renderLandingPage() {
            const html = `
              <!DOCTYPE html>
              <html>
                  <head>
                  </head>
                  <body>
                      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
                  </body>
              </html>`;
            return { html };
          },
          //highlight-end
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

The handler should return an object with a string `html` property. The value of that property is served as HTML for any requests with `accept: text/html` headers. The `html` property can also be an `async` function that returns a string. This function is called for each landing page request.

For more landing page options, see [Changing the landing page](../workflow/build-run-queries/#changing-the-landing-page).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

   plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async renderLandingPage() {
            return {
              async html() {
                return `<html><body>Welcome to your server!</body></html>`;
              },
            };
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>


### `requestDidStart`

> **New in Apollo Server 4**: In Apollo Server 4, `requestDidStart` hooks are called in parallel rather than in series.

The `requestDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server begins fulfilling a GraphQL request.

```ts
requestDidStart?(
  requestContext: GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
): Promise<GraphQLRequestListener<TContext> | void>;
```

This function can optionally return an object that includes functions for responding to [request lifecycle events](#request-lifecycle-events) that might follow `requestDidStart`.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async requestDidStart(requestContext) {
        // Within this returned object, define functions that respond
        // to request-specific lifecycle events.
        return {
          // The `parsingDidStart` request lifecycle event fires
          // when parsing begins. The event is scoped within an
          // associated `requestDidStart` server lifecycle event.
          async parsingDidStart(requestContext) {
            console.log('Parsing started!')
          },
        }
      }
    }
  ],
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

If your plugin doesn't need to respond to any request lifecycle events, `requestDidStart` should not return a value.

### `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate`

The `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate` event fires whenever Apollo Server initially loads the schema or updates the schema.

A `schemaDidLoadOrUpdate` handler is given the new API schema and optionally the new core schema (if using a gateway).

`schemaDidLoadOrUpdate` is a synchronous plugin API (i.e., it does not return a `Promise`).

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          schemaDidLoadOrUpdate({ apiSchema, coreSupergraphSdl }) {
            console.log(`The API schema is ${printSchema(apiSchema)}`);
            if (coreSupergraphSdl) {
              console.log(`The core schema is ${coreSupergraphSdl}`);
            }
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `startupDidFail`

The `startupDidFail` hook is triggered if your server fails to start. This can occur if the schema fails to load or a `serverWillStart` or `renderLandingPage` hook throws an error. This hook receives the thrown `error`, which is the same error that `await server.start()` throws.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async startupDidFail({ error }) {
        console.log(`Startup failed: ${error}`);
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>


## Request lifecycle events

> If you're using TypeScript to create your plugin, implement the [ `GraphQLRequestListener` interface](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/93ebfc742fb201f885227474836ebdeaa4ab0691/packages/server/src/externalTypes/plugins.ts#L104) to define functions for request lifecycle events.

When Apollo Server processes a request, these events fire in the order listed (with the exception of `didEncounterErrors`, which might fire in one of a few places depending on when errors occur). [See the flow diagram](./plugins/#request-lifecycle-event-flow)

Note that not every event fires for every request (for example, `parsingDidStart` doesn't fire for an operation that Apollo Server has cached and doesn't need to parse again).

### `didResolveSource`

The `didResolveSource` event is invoked after Apollo Server has determined the
`String`-representation of the incoming operation that it will act upon.  In the
event that this `String` was not directly passed in from the client, this
may be retrieved from a cache store (e.g., Automated Persisted Queries).

At this stage, there is not a guarantee that the operation is not malformed.

```ts
didResolveSource?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>, 'source' | 'queryHash'>,
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `parsingDidStart`

The `parsingDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server will parse a GraphQL
request to create its associated `document` AST.

If Apollo Server receives a request with a query string that matches a _previous_
request, the associated `document` might already be available in Apollo Server's cache.
In this case, `parsingDidStart` is _not_ called for the request, because parsing
does not occur.

```ts
parsingDidStart?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>, 'source' | 'queryHash'
  >,
): Promise<void | (err?: Error) => Promise<void>>;
```

### `validationDidStart`

The `validationDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server will validate a
request's `document` AST against your GraphQL schema.

Like `parsingDidStart`, this event does _not_ fire if a request's `document` is
already available in Apollo Server's cache (only successfully validated `document`s are cached by Apollo Server).

The `document` AST is guaranteed to be
available at this stage, because parsing must succeed for validation to occur.

```ts
validationDidStart?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'source' | 'queryHash' | 'document'
  >,
): Promise<void | (err?: ReadonlyArray<Error>) => Promise<void>>;
```

### `didResolveOperation`

The `didResolveOperation` event fires after the `graphql` library successfully
determines the operation to execute from a request's `document` AST. At this stage,
both the `operationName` string and `operation` AST are available.

This event is _not_ associated with your GraphQL server's _resolvers_. When this event fires, your resolvers have not yet executed (they execute after [`executionDidStart`](#executiondidstart)).

> If the operation is anonymous (i.e., the operation is `query { ... }` instead of `query NamedQuery { ... }`), then `operationName` is `null`.

If a `didResolveOperation` hook throws a [`GraphQLError`](../data/errors#custom-errors), that error is serialized and returned to the client with an HTTP status code of 500 unless [it specifies a different status code](../data/errors#setting-http-status-code-and-headers).

The `didResolveOperation` hook is a great spot to perform extra validation because it has access to the parsed and validated operation and the request-specific context (i.e., `contextValue`). Multiple plugins can run the `didResolveOperation` in parallel, but if more than one plugin throws, the client only receives a single error.

```ts
didResolveOperation?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'source' | 'queryHash' | 'document' | 'operationName'
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `responseForOperation`

The `responseForOperation` event is fired immediately before GraphQL execution
would take place. If its return value resolves to a non-null `GraphQLResponse`,
that result is used instead of executing the query. Hooks from different plugins
are invoked in series, and the first non-null response is used.

```ts
responseForOperation?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'source' | 'queryHash' | 'document' | 'operationName' | 'operation'
): Promise<GraphQLResponse | null>;
```

### `executionDidStart`

The `executionDidStart` event fires whenever Apollo Server begins executing the
GraphQL operation specified by a request's `document` AST.

```ts
executionDidStart?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>,
    'source' | 'queryHash' | 'document' | 'operationName' | 'operation'
  >,
): Promise<GraphQLRequestExecutionListener | void>;
```

`executionDidStart` may return an object with one or both of the methods `executionDidEnd` and `willResolveField`.  `executionDidEnd` is treated like an end hook: it is called after execution with any errors that occurred. (If the operation uses [incremental delivery](../workflow/requests#incremental-delivery-experimental) directives such as `@defer`, `executionDidEnd` is called when the fields required to fill the *initial* payload have finished executing; you can use `willSendSubsequentPayload` to hook into the end of execution for each subsequent payload.) `willResolveField` is documented in the next section.

### `willResolveField`

The `willResolveField` event fires whenever Apollo Server is about to resolve a single field during the execution of an operation. The handler is passed an object with four fields (`source`, `args`, `contextValue`, and `info`) that correspond to the [four positional arguments passed to resolvers](../data/resolvers/#resolver-arguments). Note that `source` corresponds to the argument often called `parent` in our docs.

You provide your `willResolveField` handler in the object returned by your [`executionDidStart`](#executiondidstart) handler.

Your `willResolveField` handler can optionally return an ["end hook"](./plugins/#end-hooks) function that's invoked with the resolver's result (or the error that it throws). The end hook is called when your resolver has _fully_ resolved (e.g., if the resolver returns a Promise, the hook is called with the Promise's eventual resolved result).

`willResolveField` and its end hook are synchronous plugin APIs (i.e., they do not return `Promise`s).

`willResolveField` only fires when a field is resolved inside the Apollo Server itself; it does not fire at all if the server is a Gateway.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async requestDidStart(initialRequestContext) {
        return {
          async executionDidStart(executionRequestContext) {
            return {
              willResolveField({source, args, contextValue, info}) {
                const start = process.hrtime.bigint();
                return (error, result) => {
                  const end = process.hrtime.bigint();
                  console.log(`Field ${info.parentType.name}.${info.fieldName} took ${end - start}ns`);
                  if (error) {
                    console.log(`It failed with ${error}`);
                  } else {
                    console.log(`It returned ${result}`);
                  }
                };
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `didEncounterErrors`

The `didEncounterErrors` event fires when Apollo Server encounters errors while
parsing, validating, or executing a GraphQL operation. The errors are available on `requestContext.errors`.

(If the operation uses [incremental delivery](../workflow/requests#incremental-delivery-experimental) directives such as `@defer`, `didEncounterErrors` is only called when errors that will be sent in the *initial* payload are encountered; you can use `didEncounterSubsequentErrors` to find out if more errors are found later.)

```ts
didEncounterErrors?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>, 'errors'
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `didEncounterSubsequentErrors`

The `didEncounterSubsequentErrors` event only fires for operations that use [incremental delivery](../workflow/requests#incremental-delivery-experimental) directives such as `@defer`. This hook is called when any execution errors are encountered *after* the initial payload is sent; `didEncounterErrors` is *not* called in this case. The errors in question are provided as the second argument to the hook (*not* as `requestContext.errors`, which will continue to be the list of errors sent in the initial payload).

```ts
didEncounterSubsequentErrors?(
  requestContext: GraphQLRequestContextDidEncounterSubsequentErrors<TContext>,
  errors: ReadonlyArray<GraphQLError>,
): Promise<void>;
```



### `willSendResponse`

The `willSendResponse` event fires whenever Apollo Server is about to send a response
for a GraphQL operation. This event fires (and Apollo Server sends a response) even
if the GraphQL operation encounters one or more errors.

(If the operation uses [incremental delivery](../workflow/requests#incremental-delivery-experimental) directives such as `@defer`, `willSendResponse` is called before the *initial* payload is sent; you can use `willSendSubsequentPayload` to find out when more payloads will be sent.)

The `willSendResponse` event is also where you can mutate the GraphQL response in-place. For example, you can add values to the `extensions` object or redact information in the `data` block. If you need to mutate the error responses, see the [`formatError` hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/errors/#for-client-responses).

```ts
willSendResponse?(
  requestContext: WithRequired<
    GraphQLRequestContext<TContext>, 'source' | 'queryHash'
  >,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `willSendSubsequentPayload`

The `willSendSubsequentPayload` event only fires for operations that use [incremental delivery](../workflow/requests#incremental-delivery-experimental) directives such as `@defer`. This hook is called before each payload after the initial one is sent, similarly to `willSendResponse`. The payload in question is provided as the second argument to the hook (*not* on `requestContext`). If this is the last payload, `payload.hasNext` will be false. Note that the precise format of `payload` is determined by the `graphql-js` project, and incremental delivery support has not yet (as of September 2022) been released in an official release of `graphql-js`. When the official release (expected to be `graphql@17`) is released, the format of this argument may potentially change; in this case, Apollo Server may change the precise details of this hook in a backward-incompatible way in a minor release of Apollo Server. (For now, this hook can only be called if you install a pre-release of `graphql@17`.)

```ts
willSendSubsequentPayload?(
  requestContext: GraphQLRequestContextWillSendSubsequentPayload<TContext>,
  payload: GraphQLExperimentalFormattedSubsequentIncrementalExecutionResult,
): Promise<void>;
```

### `contextCreationDidFail`

The `contextCreationDidFail` event fires if the user-provided `context` function throws an error. Because the request context is incomplete, this hook only receives the `error` (not a full `GraphQLRequestContext`). If you want more information about the request that triggered this event, consider wrapping your `context` function in a `try`/`catch` block and adding the appropriate information to the thrown error.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async contextCreationDidFail({ error }) {
        console.log(`Context creation failed: ${error}`);
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `invalidRequestWasReceived`

The `invalidRequestWasReceived` event fires any time a "Bad Request" error is thrown during request execution. This includes CSRF prevention and malformed requests (e.g., incorrect headers, invalid JSON body, or invalid search params for `GET`), but *doesn't* include malformed GraphQL. Because the request context is incomplete, this hook only receives the `error` (not a full `GraphQLRequestContext`). If you want more information about the request that triggered this event, consider wrapping your `context` function in a `try`/`catch` block and adding the appropriate information to the thrown error.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async invalidRequestWasReceived({ error }) {
        console.log(`Bad request: ${error}`);
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### `unexpectedErrorProcessingRequest`

The `unexpectedErrorProcessingRequest` event fires whenever an "unexpected" error is thrown during request execution. "Unexpected" errors don't include common client data errors such as validation, parsing, or GraphQL execution errors. Instead, an unexpected error indicates a _programming_ error, such as a plugin hook throwing unexpectedly or Apollo Server encountering a bug. No matter the cause, Apollo Server masks this type of error from a client.

Note this hook is on the top level of the plugin rather than on the object returned from `requestDidStart`, because this hook triggers if `requestDidStart` throws.

#### Example

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
const server = new ApolloServer({
  /* ... other necessary configuration ... */

  plugins: [
    {
      async unexpectedErrorProcessingRequest({ requestContext,  error }) {
        console.log(`Something went wrong: ${error}`);
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>
