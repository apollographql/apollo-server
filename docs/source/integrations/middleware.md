Apollo Server integrates easily with several popular Node.js middleware libraries.
To integrate, first install the appropriate package from the table below _instead of_
the core `apollo-server` package:

| Middleware  | Package  |
|---|---|
| Express  | `apollo-server-express`  |
| AWS Lambda | `apollo-server-lambda` |
| Koa | `apollo-server-koa` |
| hapi  | `apollo-server-hapi`  |
| Micro | `apollo-server-micro` |
| Fastify  | `apollo-server-fastify`  |
| Google Cloud Functions | `apollo-server-cloud-functions` |
| Azure Functions | `apollo-server-azure-functions` |
| Cloudflare | `apollo-server-cloudflare` |


If you've already installed the core `apollo-server` package, you can `npm uninstall`
it after installing an integration package.

## Applying middleware

When integrating with middleware, first you initialize Apollo Server just like you
always do, and then you call `applyMiddleware`.

Here's a basic Express example that serves `Hello!` from every path _except_ `/graphql`, which serves a GraphQL endpoint with Apollo Server:

```js
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./schema');

async function startApolloServer() {
  const app = express();
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  });
  await server.start();

  server.applyMiddleware({ app });

  app.use((req, res) => {
    res.status(200);
    res.send('Hello!');
    res.end();
  });

  await new Promise(resolve => app.listen({ port: 4000 }, resolve));
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`);
  return { server, app };
}
```

The parameter you provide to `applyMiddleware` is your middleware's top-level representation of your application. In Express applications, this variable is commonly named `app`.

When you pass your app to `applyMiddleware`, Apollo Server automatically configures various middleware (including body parsing, an HTML UI, and CORS support), so you don't need to apply them with a mechanism like `app.use`.

> **Note:** When integrating with hapi, call `applyMiddleware` with `await`.
