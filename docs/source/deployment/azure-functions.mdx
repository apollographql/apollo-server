title: Deploying with Azure Functions
description: Deploying your GraphQL server to Azure Functions
---

<!-- TODO(AS4) update when we have an Azure Functions integration to deploy -->

This tutorial walks through setting up an example project using the [Azure Functions integration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-azure-functions) for Apollo Server.

We created this tutorial using a Linux environment. Some commands might differ if you use a Windows environment; [please refer to the Azure documentation for more details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli).

Note that `apollo-server-azure-functions` does not enable you to add arbitrary middleware to your web server (though you can manually wrap the handler returned by `createHandler` in your own handler).

## Prerequisites

You must do following before proceeding:

- Setup an [Azure](https://azure.com) account
- Install the [Azure Functions Core Tools CLI version 3.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#v2)
- Install the [Azure CLI 2.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

## Setting up the project

### Creating a new Function

We'll begin by creating a new project to test things out locally before deploying to Azure:

```shell
func init apollo-example --worker-runtime node
cd apollo-example
func new --template "Http Trigger" --name graphql
```

Next, run the `func host start` command. You should see something like the following output to your terminal:

```shell
Azure Functions Core Tools
Core Tools Version:       3.0.3477 Commit hash: 5fbb9a76fc00e4168f2cc90d6ff0afe5373afc6d  (64-bit)
Function Runtime Version: 3.0.15584.0

[2021-06-30T19:22:21.077Z] Worker process started and initialized.

Functions:

	graphql: [GET,POST] http://localhost:7071/api/graphql

For detailed output, run func with --verbose flag.
```

If you navigate to [http://localhost:7071/api/graphql?name=Apollo](http://localhost:7071/api/graphql?name=Apollo) in your browser and will now see the text: 'Hello Apollo.'

<ExpansionPanel title="Run into a problem?">

If you see an error message mentioning "Incompatible Node.js version", you should double-check that the version of `node` on your `PATH` is a version [supported by Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions?tabs=in-process%2Cv4&pivots=programming-language-javascript). If your node version is not supported, you can use a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to use a different node version.

</ExpansionPanel>

If you'd like to change the URL for this function (e.g., to something like `http://{my-url}/graphql`), you can change the URL prefix in the `host.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensions": {
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": ""
    }
  }
}
```

### Setting up Apollo Server

We'll start by installing the dependencies for `apollo-server-azure-functions` and `graphql`:

```shell
cd apollo-example
npm install apollo-server-azure-functions graphql
```

To set up the `apollo-server-azure-functions` library, replace the content of your `graphql/index.js` file with the following:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-azure-functions');
const {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault
} = require('apollo-server-core');

// Schema definition.
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Resolver map.
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

// Create our server.
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  cache: 'bounded',
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
  ],
});
exports.graphqlHandler = server.createHandler();
```

> See the [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-azure-functions) for `apollo-server-azure-functions` for more information about this package.

Next, we need to make a couple of changes to our `graphql/function.json` file:
-  Change the output `name` to `$return`
-  Add `options` to the list of `methods` (to ensure CORS works)

Your `graphql/function.json` file should now look like this:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "route": "{*segments}",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post",
        "options"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the `route` line above is only required if you'd like to use [health checks](../monitoring/health-checks).

Now return to the base folder and run the `func host start` command again:

```shell
func host start
```

Apollo Server should now be up and running! If you go back to your browser (to either [http://localhost:7071/api/graphql?name=Apollo](http://localhost:7071/api/graphql?name=Apollo) or your custom URL path) and refresh, you can now open up [Apollo Sandbox](../testing/build-run-queries/#apollo-sandbox) and run operations against your server.

## Deploying with the Azure CLI

### Creating Azure resources

Before deploying, we first need to meet the requirements to set up a new [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview).

We'll start by creating a new [Azure resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) for this project. The below command will create a resource group with the `--name` and `--location` you specify. Make sure you replace the `--location` with [your Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/).

```shell
az group create --name apollo-examples --location eastus
```

After creating a resource group, you will need to create a [storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) to store your code on Azure. Make sure to choose a **unique** name for your project's storage account.

```shell
az storage account create \
    --name apolloexampleYOURNAME \
    --location eastus \
    --resource-group apollo-examples \
    --sku Standard_LRS
```

The last resource you'll need to create is a [function app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-functionapp-create). The below command will create a new function app using the specified resource group, location, and storage account.

Note your function app name must be **unique** for this command to run successfully:

```shell
az functionapp create \
    --resource-group apollo-examples \
    --name apollo-example-YOURNAME \
    --consumption-plan-location eastus \
    --runtime node \
    --functions-version 3 \
    --storage-account apolloexampleYOURNAME
```

### Publishing

After creating a function app, you can now publish your function to Azure using the Azure CLI.

Use the command below, inserting your function app name, to publish your function:

```shell
func azure functionapp publish apollo-example-YOURNAME
```

Your terminal will output something similar to the following:
```shell
Getting site publishing info...
Preparing archive...
Uploading 4.45 MB [###############################################################################]
Upload completed successfully.
Deployment completed successfully.
Syncing triggers...
Functions in apollo-example:
    graphql - [httpTrigger]
        Invoke url: https://apollo-example.azurewebsites.net/graphql?code=4aB9bka0fXFyTVeO8jAiHTc8bmyoqx2mEabk/QDA6gu2xLcqEAJRiw==
```

You can now navigate to the `Invoke url` shown in your terminal's output to see your function app up and running.

After completing this tutorial, you can delete all of the Azure resources you created by running the [`az group`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest) command:

```shell
az group delete --name apollo-examples --yes
```

## Deploying to Azure with VS Code

You can also publish to Azure directly from VS Code using the Azure Functions Extension. Refer to the documentation on [publishing to Azure from VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code#publish-the-project-to-azure) for more information.
