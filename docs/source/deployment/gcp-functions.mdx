<!-- TODO(AS4) update when we have a Google Cloud Function integration to deploy -->

This tutorial helps you deploy Apollo Server to Google Cloud Functions. It uses the following example function handler:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

```javascript title="index.js"
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-cloud-functions');
const {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault
} = require('apollo-server-core');

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Provide resolver functions for your schema fields
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  cache: 'bounded',
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
  ],
});

exports.handler = server.createHandler();
```

</ExpansionPanel>


## Deploying from the Google Cloud Console

### 1. Configure the function

From your Google Cloud Console, go to the [Cloud Functions page](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list).

Click **Create Function**. Give the function a name and set the **Trigger type** to `HTTP`.

For quick setup and access to the GraphQL endpoint/landing page, choose to **Allow unauthenticated invocations**. To require authentication for this endpoint, you can manage authorized users via [Cloud IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam).

Save your configuration changes in the Trigger section. Copy the trigger's URL for later.

Expand the "Runtime, Build, and Connections Settings" panel and add a runtime environment variable named `NODE_ENV` with value `development`. (This overrides Cloud Function's default of `production` and will allow you to easily test your graph with Apollo Sandbox. You can delete this environment variable once you're ready for your app to be considered a production app.)

Now click **Next**.

### 2. Write the API handlers and deploy

Now on the Code page, set the runtime to a currently supported version of Node.js (such as `Node.js 14`), and set the Entry point to `handler`.

Paste the example code at the top of this page into the contents of `index.js` in the code editor.

Edit `package.json` so that it lists `apollo-server-cloud-functions` and `graphql` in its dependencies:

```json title="package.json"
  "dependencies": {
    "apollo-server-cloud-functions": "3.x",
    "graphql": "^15.5.0"
  }
```

Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment. Then, proceed to [Testing the function](#testing-the-function).


## Deploying from your local machine

Before proceeding, you need to set up the gcloud SDK:

1. [Install the gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

2. [Initialize the gcloud SDK and authenticate your Google account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing)

Next, initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in an empty directory.

Run `npm install apollo-server-cloud-functions graphql` to install the necessary dependencies and to include them in the `package.json` file.

At this point, your `package.json` should resemble the following:

```json
{
  "name": "apollo-gcloud",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "apollo-server-cloud-functions": "3.x",
    "graphql": "^15.5.0"
  }
}
```

Create a new file named `index.js` and paste the sample code at the top of this page into it.

Run the following command to create and deploy the function to Cloud Functions:

```bash
gcloud functions deploy apollo-graphql-example --entry-point handler --runtime nodejs14 --trigger-http
```

This creates a function named `apollo-graphql-example` that you can view from your console's [Cloud Functions page](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list)

The command asks some configuration questions and prints metadata about your newly created function, which includes the function's trigger URL.

For more information, see the official [Cloud Functions docs](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/deploying/filesystem).

## Testing the function

After deployment completes, navigate to your function's trigger URL, with `/graphql` added to the end. If deployment succeeded, you should see your server's landing page.

> If you can't access your trigger URL, you might need to [give `allAuthenticatedUsers` or `allUsers` the `Cloud Functions Invoker` role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#all-authenticated-users) on the Permissions tab.

Click <q>Query your Server</q> and use Apollo Sandbox to test the following query:

```graphql
query TestQuery {
  hello
}
```

And verify that the following response appears:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello world!"
  }
}
```

## Getting request details

To obtain information about a currently executing Google Cloud Function (HTTP headers, HTTP method, body, path, etc.) use the `context` option. This enables you to pass any request-specific data to your server's resolvers.

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-cloud-functions');
const {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault
} = require('apollo-server-core');

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Provide resolver functions for your schema fields
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  cache: 'bounded',
  context: ({ req, res }) => ({
    headers: req.headers,
    req,
    res,
  }),
  plugins: [
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageLocalDefault({ embed: true }),
  ],
});

exports.handler = server.createHandler();
```

## Enabling production mode

When you consider your app to be production-ready, you should remember to edit it to remove the `NODE_ENV` environment variable you set at the beginning. Among other things, this will change its landing page to be more discreet, and will mask error details from the end user.
