description: What is Apollo Server and what does it do?

> This is the documentation for the 1.x version of Apollo Server. For new projects, we recommend using [Apollo Server 2](/docs/apollo-server/v2/)

Apollo Server is a library that helps you connect a GraphQL schema to an HTTP server in Node. Apollo Server works with any GraphQL schema built with [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js), so you can build your schema with that directly or with a convenience library such as [graphql-tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/). You can use Apollo Server with all popular JavaScript HTTP servers, including Express, Connect, Hapi, Koa, Restify, and Lambda.

It's open-source and works great as a stand-alone server, an addon to an existing Node.js HTTP server, or in "serverless" environments.

Apollo Server implements a spec-compliant GraphQL server which can be queried from any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](/docs/react), enabling:

1.  **An easy start**, so front-end and back-end developers can start fetching data quickly.
2.  **Incremental adoption**, allowing advanced features to be added when they're needed.
3.  **Universal compatibility** with any data source, any build tool and any GraphQL client.
4.  **Production readiness**, and what you build in development works great in production.

These docs will help you go from getting started with Apollo to becoming an expert in no time!
