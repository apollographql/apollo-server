Thanks for filing an issue on Apollo Server!

Before reporting a bug, please first check for existing or closed issues
and read the instructions for filing a bug report:

https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs

### This bug report should include:

- [ ] A short, but descriptive title. The title doesn't need "Apollo" in it.
- [ ] The package name and version of Apollo showing the problem.
- [ ] If applicable, the last version of Apollo where the problem did _not_ occur.
- [ ] The expected behavior.
- [ ] The actual behavior.
- [ ] A **simple**, runnable reproduction!
      Please make a GitHub repository that anyone can clone and run and see the
      problem. Other great ways to demonstrate a reproduction are using our
      CodeSandbox template (https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-server), or re-mixing
      our Glitch template (https://glitch.com/~apollo-launchpad).

  Please make sure that you include the following information to ensure that your issue is actionable.

  If you don't follow the template, your issue may end up being closed without anyone looking at it carefully, because it is not actionable for us without the information in this template.
