# CHANGELOG

The version headers in this history reflect the versions of Apollo Server itself.  Versions of other packages (e.g., those which are not actual HTTP integrations; packages not prefixed with "`apollo-server`", or just supporting packages) may use different versions.

🆕 **Please Note!**: 🆕 **The `@apollo/federation` and `@apollo/gateway` packages now live in the [`apollographql/federation`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation) repository.**

- [`@apollo/gateway`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/HEAD/gateway-js/CHANGELOG.md)
- [`@apollo/federation`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/HEAD/federation-js/CHANGELOG.md)

## vNEXT

> The changes noted within this `vNEXT` section have not been released yet.  New PRs and commits which introduce changes should include an entry in this `vNEXT` section as part of their development.  With few exceptions, the format of the entry should follow convention (i.e., prefix with package name, use markdown `backtick formatting` for package names and code, suffix with a link to the change-set à la `[PR #YYY](https://link/pull/YYY)`, etc.).  When a release is being prepared, a new header will be (manually) created below and the appropriate changes within that release will be moved into the new section.

- `apollo-server-express`: types: Export `ExpressContext` from main module. [PR #4821](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4821) [Issue #3699](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3699)

## v2.19.1

- `apollo-server-core`: The `debugPrintReports` option to `ApolloServerPluginUsageReporting` now prints traces as well. [PR #4805](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4805)

## v2.19.0

- `apollo-server-testing`: types: Allow generic `variables` usage of `query` and `mutate` functions. [PR #4383](https://github.com/apollograpqh/apollo-server/pull/4383)
- `apollo-server-express`: Export the `GetMiddlewareOptions` type. [PR #4599](https://github.com/apollograpqh/apollo-server/pull/4599)
- `apollo-server-lambda`: Fix file uploads - ignore base64 decoding for multipart queries. [PR #4506](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4506)
- `apollo-server-core`: Do not send  operation documents that cannot be executed to Apollo Studio. Instead, information about these operations will be combined into one "operation" for parse failures, one for validation failures, and one for unknown operation names.

## v2.18.2

- `apollo-server-core`: Explicitly include `lru-cache` dependency in `apollo-server-core`'s dependencies. [PR #4600](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4600)

## v2.18.1

- `apollo-server-core`: Fix support for legacy option `engine: {logger}`, broken in v2.18.0. [PR #4588](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4588)

- `apollo-server-plugin-base`: The `ApolloServerPlugin` TypeScript type does not need to extend `AnyFunctionMap`, which was an unnecessary change in v2.18.0. [PR #4588](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4588)

- `apollo-server-core`: Improve a usage reporting error which occurs when you use Apollo Server in an unsupported way. [PR #4588](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4588)

- `apollo-server-core`: Fix typo in error message for unparsable/invalid schemas provided via `overrideReportedSchema`. [PR #4581](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4581)

## v2.18.0

- `apollo-server-core`: When Apollo Server is configured with an Apollo API key, the URLs it uses to connect to Apollo's servers have changed. If the environment in which you run your servers requires you to explicitly allow connections by domain, you will need to add the new domain names. Usage reporting previously connected to https://engine-report.apollodata.com/ and now connects to https://usage-reporting.api.apollographql.com/; schema reporting previously connected to https://edge-server-reporting.api.apollographql.com/ and now connects to https://schema-reporting.api.apollographql.com/ . [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- Apollo Server's support for communicating with Apollo’s commercial products has been refactored into three separate plugins exported from `apollo-server-core` (for usage reporting, schema reporting, and inline tracing), configured using the standard `plugins` option. The `engine` option continues to work for backwards compatibility in the 2.x series; support for `engine` will be deprecated in Apollo Server 3.x. Full details are available in [the migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration-engine-plugins/). [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- To consistently support tracing, inline tracing is enabled by default on federated implementing services, even when an Apollo API key is provided.  Previously it was not enabled when an API key was provided. You can disable it with `ApolloServerPluginInlineTraceDisabled`. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- The `apollo-engine-reporting` npm package has been obsoleted and will no longer receive updates. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- The `apollo-engine-reporting-protobuf` package has been renamed to `apollo-reporting-protobuf`.  No new versions of the old package will be published. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- Implementations of `ApolloServer` for serverless frameworks such as Lambda now override the `serverlessFramework()` method to return true.  We have changed our own integrations, but other implementations that extend `ApolloServer` which need this behavior should do the same.  Support for `engine.sendReportsImmediately` will be dropped in Apollo Server 3.x. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- The `GraphQLServiceContext` type passed to the plugin serverWillStart method now contains `apollo` and `serverlessFramework` values. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- `apollo-server-core` / `apollo-server-plugin-base`: The request pipeline plugin API now supports a `serverWillStop` lifecycle hook. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- `apollo-server-core`: Previously, the usage reporting functionality registered one-shot handlers for the `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals, which it used to send one final usage report before re-sending the signal to itself to continue shutdown. These signals handlers were installed by default if you enabled usage or schema reporting, and could be disabled by passing `engine.handleSignals: false`. Now, termination signal handling is the responsibility of Apollo Server as a whole rather than something specific to usage reporting. Apollo Server itself now registers these one-shot signal handlers, which trigger `ApolloServer.stop()`. This allows any plugin that implements the new `serverWillStop` callback to hook into shutdown logic, not just the usage reporting code. Similarly to before, these signal handlers are registered by default but can be disabled by via an option. We've changed the option name to `stopOnTerminationSignals: false` as it is more explicit about the behavior. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- `apollo-server-core`: The default logger implementation (if you don't specify your own `logger` or specify `debug`) now logs at the INFO level instead of the WARN level. The main effect is on a few built-in plugins which log one INFO message at startup; if a custom plugin logs at the INFO level then those messages will be visible by default as well. [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- `apollo-server-core`: Parse and validate any schema passed via `overrideReportedSchema` to the schema reporting plugin, and throw accordingly on unparsable or invalid schemas.

- Using Apollo Server from TypeScript now requires TypeScript 3.8 due to the use of the `import type` and `export type` directives. (If this proves to be a major problem we can revert this choice, but it makes it easier for us to ensure that certain large dependencies are only loaded when needed.) [PR #4453](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4453)

- Updated `@apollographql/graphql-playground-react` to 1.7.33 to include [an upstream fix](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-playground/commit/1c102692bfbb717688827204186c15cb92629b3a). [PR #4550](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4550)

## v2.17.0

- subscriptions: Fix bug which prevented `installSubscriptionHandlers` from accepting a `websocket.Server` (as intended in [PR #1966](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1966)) and also added support for other `http.Server` variations (e.g., Tls). [Issue #4198](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/4198) [PR #4200](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4200)

## v2.16.1

- This release only includes patch updates to dependencies.

## v2.16.0

- `apollo-server-fastify`: Pass Fastify's `request` and `reply` objects into the `context` function, which previously had been receiving nothing. [Issue #3156](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3156) [PR #3895(https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3895)
- `apollo-server-lamdbda`: Automatically decode payloads which are Base64-encoded when the `isBase64Encoded` boolean is present on Lambda `event` payloads. [PR #4311](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4311)

## v2.15.1

- The default branch of the repository has been changed to `main`.  As this changed a number of references in the repository's `package.json` and `README.md` files (e.g., for badges, links, etc.), this necessitates a release to publish those changes to npm. [PR #4302](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4302)

## v2.15.0

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Added a `reportTiming` API to allow trace reporting to be enabled or disabled on a per request basis. The option takes either a boolean or a predicate function that takes a [`GraphQLRequestContextDidResolveOperation`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/a926b7eedbb87abab2ec70fb03d71743985cb18d/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L185-L190) or [`GraphQLRequestContextDidEncounterErrors`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/a926b7eedbb87abab2ec70fb03d71743985cb18d/packages/apollo-server-types/src/index.ts#L191-L195) and returns a boolean. If the boolean is false the request will not be instrumented for tracing and no trace will be sent to Apollo Graph Manager.  The default is `true` so all traces will get instrumented and sent, which is the same as the previous default behavior. [PR #3918](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3918)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Removed `GraphQLServerOptions.reporting`. It isn't known whether a trace will be reported at the beginning of the request because of the above change. We believe this field was only used internally within Apollo Server; let us know if this is a problem and we can suggest alternatives. Additionally, the field `requestContext.metrics.captureTraces` is now initialized later in the request pipeline.  [PR #3918](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3918)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Make Apollo Server throw if schema reporting is enabled for a gateway or federated service. [PR #4246](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4246)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Remove the `experimental_` prefix from schema reporting options, and specifically rename `experimental_schemaReporting` option name to `reportSchema`. (The old option names remain functional, but are deprecated.) [PR #4236](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4236)

## v2.14.5

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Make Apollo Server throw if schema reporting is enabled for a gateway or federated service. [PR #4246](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4246)

## v2.14.4

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Add environment variable `APOLLO_SCHEMA_REPORTING` that can enable schema reporting. If `experimental__schemaReporting` is set it will override the environment variable. [PR #4206](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4206)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: The schema reporting URL has been changed to use the new dedicated sub-domain `https://edge-server-reporting.api.apollographql.com`. [PR #4232](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4232)
- `apollo-server-core`: Though Apollo Server **is not affected** due to the way it is integrated, in response to [an upstream security advisory for GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-4852-vrh7-28rf) we have published [the same patch](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground/commit/bf1883db538c97b076801a60677733816cb3cfb7) on our `@apollographql/graphql-playground-html` fork and bumped Apollo Server to use it.  Again, this was done out of an **abundance of caution** since the way that Apollo Server utilizes `renderPlaygroundPage` is _not_ vulnerable as it does not allow per-request Playground configuration that could allow interpolation of user-input. [PR #4231](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4231)

## v2.14.3

- This release only includes patch updates to dependencies.

## v2.14.2

> **Note:** This release is is related to a GitHub Security Advisory published by the Apollo Server team.  Please read the attached advisory to understand the impact.

- ⚠️ **SECURITY:** Pass all schema validation rules to the subscription server, including validation rules that restrict introspection when introspection is meant to be disabled. **[Read the full GitHub Security Advisory for details](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-w42g-7vfc-xf37)**.

## v2.14.1

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/2da65ef9204027e43baedf9ce385bb3794fd0c9b)

- `apollo-server-testing`: Ensure that user-provided context is cloned when using `createTestClient`, per the instructions in the [intergration testing]() section of the Apollo Server documentation.  [Issue #4170](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/4170) [PR #4175](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4175)

## v2.14.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/d159e320879f594ba2d04036e3e1aa0653ff164d)

- `apollo-server-core` / `apollo-server-plugin-base`: Add support for `willResolveField` and corresponding end-handler within `executionDidStart`.  This brings the remaining bit of functionality that was previously only available from `graphql-extensions` to the new plugin API.  The `graphql-extensions` API (which was never documented) will be deprecated in Apollo Server 3.x.  To see the documentation for the request pipeline API, see [its documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/).  For more details, see the attached PR.  [PR #3988](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3988)
- `apollo-server-core`: Deprecate `graphql-extensions`.  All internal usages of the `graphql-extensions` API have been migrated to the request pipeline plugin API.  For any implementor-supplied `extensions`, a deprecation warning will be printed once per-extension, per-server-startup, notifying of the intention to deprecate.  Extensions should migrate to the plugin API, which is outlined in [its documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/). [PR #4135](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4135)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: **Currently only for non-federated graphs.**
  Added an _experimental_ schema reporting option,
  `experimental_schemaReporting`, for Apollo Graph Manager users. **During
  this experiment, we'd appreciate testing and feedback from current and new
  users of the schema registry!**

  Prior to the introduction of this feature, the only way to get schemas into
  the schema registry in Apollo Graph Manager was to use the CLI and run
  `apollo schema:push`. _Apollo schema reporting protocol_ is a *new*
  specification for GraphQL servers to automatically report schemas to the
  Apollo Graph Manager schema registry.

  **To enable schema reporting,** provide a Graph Manager API key (available
  free from [Apollo Graph Manager](https://engine.apollographql.com/)) in the
  `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable *and* set the `experimental_schemaReporting`
  option to `true` in the Apollo Server constructor options, like so:

  ```js
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    engine: {
      experimental_schemaReporting: true,
      /* Other existing options can remain the same. */
    },
  });
  ```

  > When enabled, a schema reporter is initiated by the `apollo-engine-reporting` agent.  It will loop until the `ApolloServer` instance is stopped, periodically calling back to Apollo Graph Manager to send information.  The life-cycle of this reporter is managed by the agent.

  For more details on the implementation of this new protocol, see the PR which
  introduced it to Apollo Server and the [preview documentation](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-schema-reporting-preview-docs).

  [PR #4084](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/4084)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: The underlying integration of this plugin, which instruments and traces the graph's resolver performance and transmits these metrics to [Apollo Graph Manager](https://engine.apollographql.com/), has been changed from the (soon to be deprecated) `graphql-extensions` API to the new [request pipeline `plugins` API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/). [PR #3998](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3998)

  _This change should be purely an implementation detail for a majority of users_.  There are, however, some special considerations which are worth noting:

    - The federated tracing plugin's `ftv1` response on `extensions` (which is present on the response from an implementing service to the gateway) is now placed on the `extensions` _after_ the `formatResponse` hook.  Anyone leveraging the `extensions`.`ftv1` data from the `formatResponse` hook will find that it is no longer present at that phase.
- `apollo-tracing`: This package's internal integration with Apollo Server has been switched from using the soon-to-be-deprecated `graphql-extensions` API to using [the request pipeline plugin API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/).  Behavior should remain otherwise the same.  [PR #3991](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3991)
- `apollo-cache-control`: This package's internal integration with Apollo Server has been switched from using the soon-to-be-deprecated `graphql-extensions` API to using [the request pipeline plugin API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/).  Behavior should remain otherwise the same.  [PR #3997](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3997)

## v2.13.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/e37384a49b2bf474eed0de3e9f4a1bebaeee64c7)

- Allow passing a `WebSocket.Server` to `ApolloServer.installSubscriptionHandlers`. [PR #2314](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2314)
- `apollo-server-lambda`: Support file uploads on AWS Lambda [Issue #1419](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/1419) [Issue #1703](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/1703) [PR #3926](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3926)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Fix inadvertant conditional formatting which prevented automated persisted query (APQ) hits and misses from being reported to Apollo Graph Manager. [PR #3986](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3986)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Deprecate the `ENGINE_API_KEY` environment variable in favor of its new name, `APOLLO_KEY`.  Continued use of `ENGINE_API_KEY` will result in deprecation warnings and support for it will be removed in a future major version. [#3923](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3923)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Deprecated the `APOLLO_SCHEMA_TAG` environment variable in favor of its new name, `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT`.  Similarly, within the `engine` configuration object, the `schemaTag` property has been renamed `graphVariant`.  The functionality remains otherwise unchanged, but their new names mirror the name used within Apollo Graph Manager.  Continued use of the now-deprecated names will result in deprecation warnings and support will be dropped completely in the next "major" update.  To avoid misconfiguration, a runtime error will be thrown if _both_ new and deprecated names are set. [PR #3855](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3855)
- `apollo-engine-reporting-protobuf`: __(This is a breaking change only if you directly depend on `apollo-engine-reporting-protobuf`.)__ Drop legacy fields that were never used by `apollo-engine-reporting`. Added new fields `StatsContext` to allow `apollo-server` to send summary stats instead of full traces, and renamed `FullTracesReport` to `Report` and `Traces` to `TracesAndStats` since reports now can include stats as well as traces.

## v2.12.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/71a3863f59f4ab2c9052c316479d94c6708c4309)

- `apollo-server-core`: Support providing a custom logger implementation (e.g. [`winston`](https://npm.im/winston), [`bunyan`](https://npm.im/bunyan), etc.) to capture server console messages.  Though there has historically been limited output from Apollo Server, some messages are important to capture in the larger context of production logging facilities or can benefit from using more advanced structure, like JSON-based logging.  This also introduces a `logger` property to the `GraphQLRequestContext` that is exposed to plugins, making it possible for plugins to leverage the same server-level logger, and allowing implementors to create request-specific log contexts, if desired.  When not provided, these will still output to `console`. [PR #3894](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3894)
- `apollo-server-core`: When operating in gateway mode using the `gateway` property of the Apollo Server constructor options, the failure to initialize a schema during initial start-up, e.g. connectivity problems, will no longer result in the federated executor from being assigned when the schema eventually becomes available.  This precludes a state where the gateway may never become available to serve federated requests, even when failure conditions are no longer present. [PR #3811](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3811)
- `apollo-server-core`: Prevent a condition which prefixed an error message on each request when the initial gateway initialization resulted in a Promise-rejection which was memoized and re-prepended with `Invalid options provided to ApolloServer:` on each request. [PR #3811](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3811)
- `apollo-server-express`: Disable the automatic inclusion of the `x-powered-by: express` header. [PR #3821](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3821)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Avoid creating new arrays when building trace trees. [PR #3479](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3479)
- `apollo-server-core`: Bump `graphql` `peerDependencies` range to include `^15.0.0`. [PR #3944](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3944)

## v2.11.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/056f083ddaf116633e6f759a2b3d69248bb18f66)

- The range of accepted `peerDepedencies` versions for `graphql` has been widened to include `graphql@^15.0.0-rc.2` so as to accommodate the latest release-candidate of the `graphql@15` package, and an intention to support it when it is finally released on the `latest` npm tag.  While this change will subdue peer dependency warnings for Apollo Server packages, many dependencies from outside of this repository will continue to raise similar warnings until those packages own `peerDependencies` are updated.  It is unlikely that all of those packages will update their ranges prior to the final version of `graphql@15` being released, but if everything is working as expected, the warnings can be safely ignored. [PR #3825](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3825)

## v2.10.1

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/dba97895485d6444535a684d4646f1363954f698)

- `apollo-server-core`: Update GraphQL Playground to latest version to remove a rogue curly-brace appearing in the top-right corner of the interface under certain conditions. [PR #3702](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3702) [Playground PR](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-playground/pull/21)
- `apollo-server-core`: Typings: Allow the `cache` property inside `persistedQueries` to be optional.  This was already optional at runtime where it defaults to the top-level global cache when unspecified, but with the introduction of the `ttl` property, it now makes sense that one may be provided without the other. [#3671](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3671)

## v2.10.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/9c0aa1e661ccc2c5a1471b781102637dd47e21b1)

- `apollo-server-express`: Support `CorsOptionsDelegate` type on `cors` parameter to `applyMiddleware`, to align with the supported type of the underlying [`cors`](https://npm.im/cors) middleware [itself](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/31483b781ac30f98bdf4d40a517e921f2fc2ce37/types/cors/index.d.ts#L32). [#3613](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3613)
- `apollo-server-core`: Allow asynchronous initialization of datasources: the `initialize` method on datasources may now return a Promise, which will be settled before any resolvers are called. [#3639](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3639)
- `apollo-server-core`: experimental: Allow configuration of the parsed/validated document store by introducing an `experimental_approximateDocumentStoreMiB` property to the `ApolloServer` constructor options which overrides the default cache size of 30MiB. [#3755](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3755)

- `apollo-server-core`: Update apollo-tooling dependencies, resolve TS build error (missing types for node-fetch) [#3662](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3662)

## v2.9.15

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/0743d6b2f1737758cf09e80d2086917772bc00c9)

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Fix regression introduced by [#3614](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3614) which caused `PersistedQueryNotFoundError`, `PersistedQueryNotSupportedError` and `InvalidGraphQLRequestError` errors to be triggered before the `requestDidStart` handler triggered `treeBuilder`'s `startTiming` method. This fix preserves the existing behavior by special-casing these specific errors.  [#3638](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3638) fixes [#3627](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3627)
- `apollo-server-cloud-functions`: Transmit CORS headers on `OPTIONS` request. [#3557](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3557)
- `apollo-server-caching`: De-compose options interface for `KeyValueCache.prototype.set` to accommodate better TSDoc annotations for its properties (e.g. to specify that `ttl` is defined in _seconds_). [#3619](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3619)
- `apollo-server-core`, `apollo-server-caching`: Introduce a `ttl` property, specified in seconds, on the options for automated persisted queries (APQ) which applies specific TTL settings to the cache `set`s during APQ registration.  Previously, all APQ cache records were set to 300 seconds.  Additionally, this adds support (to the underlying `apollo-server-caching` mechanisms) for a time-to-live (TTL) value of `null` which, when supported by the cache implementation, skips the assignment of a TTL value altogether.  This allows the cache's controller to determine when eviction happens (e.g. cache forever, and purge least recently used when the cache is full), which may be desireable for network cache stores (e.g. Memcached, Redis). [#3623](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3623)
- `apollo-server-core`: Upgrade TS to 3.7.3 [#3618](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3618)

## v2.9.14

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/ad5eac5ea1741142122e4cb8fd34a9748be31e89)

- `apollo-server-core`: Ensure that plugin's `didEncounterErrors` hooks are invoked for known automated persisted query (APQ) errors. [#3614](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3614)
- `apollo-server-plugin-base`: Move `TContext` generic from `requestDidStart` method to `ApolloServerPlugin` Interface. [#3525](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3525)

## v2.9.13

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/a0a60e73e04e913d388de8324f7d17e4406deea2)

- `@apollo/gateway`: Add `@types/node-fetch` as a regular dependency to avoid missing dependency for TypeScript consumers. [#3546](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3546) fixes [#3471](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3471)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Declare acceptable `graphql` versions ranges in `peerDependencies` rather than allowing it to occur implicitly (and less ideally) via its consumers (e.g. most `apollo-server-*` packages). [#3496](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3496)

## v2.9.12

- Reinstate [#3530](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3530) via [#3539](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3539) - after a patch release of the `@apollo/protobufjs` fork, the build issue for consumers should be resolved.

## v2.9.11

- Revert [#3530](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3530) via [#3535](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3535)- the introduction of the `@apollo/protobufjs` fork is causing TS errors in consumer projects. Reverting this change for now, and will reintroduce it after the issue is resolved within the forked package.

## v2.9.10

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/2a4c654986a158aaccf947ee56a4bfc48a3173c7)

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Swap usage of `protobufjs` for a newly published fork located at [`@apollo/protobufjs`](https://npm.im/@apollo/protobufjs). This is to account for the [relative uncertainty](https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/issues/1199) into the continued on-going maintenance of the official `protobuf.js` project. This should immediately resolve a bug that affected `Long` types in `apollo-engine-reporting` and other non-Apollo projects that rely on `protobuf.js`'s `Long` type. [#3530](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3530)

## v2.9.9

- `apollo-server-core`: Don't try parsing `variables` and `extensions` as JSON if they are defined but empty strings. [#3501](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3501)
- `apollo-server-lambda`: Introduce `onHealthCheck` on `createHandler` in the same fashion as implemented in other integrations. [#3458](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3458)
- `apollo-server-core`: Use `graphql`'s `isSchema` to more defensively check the user-specified schema's type at runtime and prevent unexpected errors. [#3462](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3462)

## v2.9.8

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/3cdde1b7a71ace6411fbacf82a1a61bf737444a6)

- `apollo-server-core`: Provide accurate type for `formatResponse` rather than generic `Function` type. [#3431](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3431)
- `apollo-server-core`: Pass complete request context to `formatResponse`, rather than just `context`. [#3431](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3431)

## v2.9.7

## v2.9.6

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/fc7462ec5f8604bd6cba99aa9a377a9b8e045566)

- `@apollo/gateway`, `@apollo/federation`, `apollo-engine-reporting`: Update `apollo-graphql` dependency to bring in [`apollo-tooling`'s #1551](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/pull/1551) which resolve runtime errors when its source is minified.  While this fixes a particular minification bug when Apollo Server packages are minified, we _do not_ recommend minification of server code in most cases. [#3387](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3387) fixes [#3335](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3335)
- `apollo-server-koa`: Correctly declare dependency on `koa-compose`. [#3356](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3356)
- `apollo-server-core`: Preserve any `extensions` that have been placed on the response when pre-execution errors occur. [#3394](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3394)

## v2.9.3

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/a1fbf95fc01739d5cbaa59919149bb85c563fdaa)

- `apollo-server-express`: Add direct dependency on `express` to allow for usage of `express.Router` for `getMiddleware` functionality (from [#2435](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2435)).  Previously, unlike other server integration packages, `apollo-server-express` did not directly need `express` as a dependency since it only relied on `express` for TypeScript typings. [#3239](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3239) fixes [#3238](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3238)
- `apollo-server-lambda`: Add `@types/aws-lambda` as a direct dependency to `apollo-server-express` to allow usage of its typings without needing to separately install it. [#3242](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3242) fixes [#2351](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issue/2351)

## v2.9.2

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/92ea402a90bf9817c9b887707abbd77dcf5edcb4)

- `apollo-server-koa`: **Drop support for Node.js v6 within the Apollo Server Koa integration in order to update `koa-bodyparser` dependency from `v3.0.0` to `v4.2.1`.** [#3229](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3229) fixes [#3050](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3050)
- `apollo-server-express`: Use explicit return type for new `getMiddleware` method. [#3230](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3230) (hopefully) fixes [#3222](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3222)

## v2.9.1

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/029c8dca3af812ee70589cdb6de749df3d2843d8)

- `apollo-server-core`: Make `formatError` available to subscriptions in the same spirit as the existing `formatResponse`. [#2942](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2942)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: The behavior of the `engine.maxAttempts` parameter previously did not match its documentation. It is documented as being the max number of attempts *including* the initial attempt, but until this release it was actually the number of retries *excluding* the initial attempt. The behavior has been changed to match the documentation (and the literal reading of the option name). [#3218](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3218)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: When sending the report fails with a server-side 5xx error, include the full error from the server in the logs. [#3218](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3218)
- `apollo-server-core`: Fix regression which prevented the resizing of the schema panel in GraphQL Playground. [#3224](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3224) and [upstream](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-playground/pull/19)

## v2.9.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/6037f6e80fdaa53b50b99ae94d93c724c382c23c)

- `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-koa`: A new `getMiddleware` method has been introduced, which accepts the same parameters as `applyMiddleware` with the exception of the `app` property.  This allows implementors to obtain the middleware directly and "`use`" it within an existing `app`.  In the near-term, this should ease some of the pain points with the previous technique.  Longer-term, we are exploring what we consider to be a much more natural approach by introducing an "HTTP transport" in Apollo Server 3.x.  See [this proposal issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3184) for more information.  [#2435](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2435)
- `@apollo/federation`: `buildFederatedSchema`'s `typeDefs` parameter now accepts arrays of `DocumentNode`s (i.e. type definitions wrapped in `gql`) and `resolvers` to make the migration from a single service into a federated service easier for teams previously utilizing this pattern. [#3188](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3188)

## v2.8.2

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/99f78c6782bce170186ba6ef311182a8c9f281b7)

- `@apollo/gateway`: Change the `setInterval` timer, which is used to continuously check for updates to a federated graph from the Apollo Graph Manager, to be an `unref`'d timer.  Without this change, the server wouldn't terminate properly once polling had started since the event-loop would continue to have unprocessed events on it. [PR #3105](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3105)
- Switch to using community `@types/graphql-upload` types.
- `apollo-server-fastify`: Change the typing of the HTTP `response` from `OutgoingMessage` to `ServerResponse`. [Commit](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/7638f643fa0445f5f8151ef884da779d85fb954c)
- `apollo-server-hapi`: Pass the `raw` request and response objects to `graphql-upload`s `processRequest` method to align on the same TypeScript types. [Commit](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/8e49b288a6aecd0e134637e64ef4ed751aa8d304)

- `@apollo/federation`: Add support for "value types", which are type definitions which live on multiple services' types, inputs, unions or interfaces.  These common types must be identical by name, kind and field across all services. [PR #3063](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3063)
- `apollo-server-express`: Use the Express `send` method, rather than calling `net.Socket.prototype.end`. [PR #2842](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2842)
- `apollo-server-hapi`: Update internal dependencies to use scoped packages `@hapi/accept` and `@hapi/boom`, in place of `accept` and `boom` respectively. [PR #3089](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3089)

## v2.7.2

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/d0b33f20ba4731c071d6fd8cfaeca1a1f3d83e4b)

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Fix reporting errors from backend. (The support for federated metrics introduced in v2.7.0 did not properly handle GraphQL errors from the backend; all users of federated metrics should upgrade to this version.) [PR #3056](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3056) [Issue #3052](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3052)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: Clean up `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` handlers when `EngineReportingAgent` is stopped; fixes 'Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected' log. [PR #3090](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3090)

## v2.7.1

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/2f87e4af9a6f1e3c8f4c51b4f77860bd3150c8c6)

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: If an error is thrown by a custom variable transform function passed into the reporting option `sendVariableValues: { transform: ... }`, all variable values will be replaced with the string `[PREDICATE_FUNCTION_ERROR]`.
- `apollo-server-express`: Typing fix for the `connection` property, which was missing from the `ExpressContext` interface.  [PR #2959](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2959)
- `@apollo/gateway`: Ensure execution of correct document within multi-operation documents by including the `operationName` in the cache key used when caching query plans used in federated execution. [PR #3084](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3084)

## v2.7.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/1d44f3d4756d43123eb01bf293e65f4a3c2e64c8)

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: **Behavior change**: By default, send no GraphQL variable values to Apollo's servers instead of sending all variable values. Adding the new EngineReportingOption `sendVariableValues` to send some or all variable values, possibly after transforming them. This replaces the `privateVariables` option, which is now deprecated. [PR #2931](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2931)

  To maintain the previous behavior of transmitting **all** GraphQL variable values, unfiltered, to Apollo Engine, configure `engine`.`sendVariableValues` as follows:

  ```js
  engine: {
    sendVariableValues: { all: true }
  }
  ```
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: **Behavior change**: By default, send no GraphQL request headers and values to Apollo's servers instead of sending all. Adding the new EngineReportingOption `sendHeaders` to send some or all header values. This replaces the `privateHeaders` option, which is now deprecated. [PR #2931](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2931)

   To maintain the previous behavior of transmitting  **all** GraphQL request headers and values, configure `engine`.`sendHeaders` as following:
     ```js
     engine: {
       sendHeaders: { all: true }
     }
     ```
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: **Behavior change**: If the error returned from the `engine.rewriteError` hook has an `extensions` property, that property will be used instead of the original error's extensions. Document that changes to most other `GraphQLError` fields by `engine.rewriteError` are ignored. [PR #2932](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2932)
- `apollo-engine-reporting`: **Behavior change**: The `engine.maskErrorDetails` option, deprecated by `engine.rewriteError` in v2.5.0, now behaves a bit more like the new option: while all error messages will be redacted, they will still show up on the appropriate nodes in a trace. [PR #2932](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2932)
- `apollo-server-core`, `@apollo/gateway`: **Introduced managed federation support**.  For more information on managed federation, see [the blog post](https://blog.apollographql.com/announcing-managed-federation-265c9f0bc88e) or jump to the [documentation for managed federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/federation/).
- `@apollo/gateway@0.7.1`: Don't print a warning about an unspecified "graph variant" (previously, and in many ways still, known as "schema tag") every few seconds.  We do highly recommend specifying one when using the Apollo Platform features though! [PR #3043](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3043)
- `graphql-playground`: Update to resolve incorrect background color on tabs when using the `light` theme. [PR #2989](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2989) [Issue #2979](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/2979)
- `graphql-playground`: Fix "Query Planner" and "Tracing" panels which were off the edge of the viewport.

- `apollo-server-core`: Allow request pipeline life-cycle hooks (i.e. plugins) to modify the response's `http.status` code (an integer) in the event of an error.  When combined with the new `didEncounterErrors` life-cycle hook (see above), this will allow modifying the HTTP status code in the event of an error.  [PR #2714](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2714)
- `apollo-server-lambda`: Set `callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` to `false` for `OPTIONS` requests to return as soon as the `callback` is triggered instead of waiting for the event loop to empty. [PR #2638](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2638)
- `apollo-server`: Support `onHealthCheck` in the `ApolloServer` constructor in the same way as `cors` is supported.  This contrasts with the `-express`, `-hapi`, etc. variations which accept this parameter via their `applyMiddleware` methods and will remain as-is.  [PR #2672](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2672)
- core: Expose SHA-512 hex hash digest of the Engine API key to plugins, when available, as `engine.apiKeyHash`. [PR #2685](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2685) [PR #2736](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2736)
- `apollo-datasource-rest`: If another `Content-type` is already set on the response, don't overwrite it with `application/json`, allowing the user's initial `Content-type` to prevail. [PR #2520](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/2035)
- Don't add `cacheControl` directive if one has already been defined. [PR #2428](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2428)
- `apollo-cache-control`: Do not respond with `Cache-control` headers if the HTTP response contains `errors`. [PR #2715](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2715)
- `apollo-server-core`: Skip loading `util.promisify` polyfill in Node.js engines >= 8.0 [PR #2278](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2278)
- `apollo-server-core`: Lazy load `subscriptions-transport-ws` in core [PR #2278](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2278)
- `apollo-server-cache-redis`: **BREAKING FOR USERS OF `apollo-server-cache-redis`** (This is a package that must be updated separately but shares the same `CHANGELOG.md` with Apollo Server itself.)  A new **major** version of this package has been published and updated to support Redis Standalone, Cluster and Sentinel modes.  This is a breaking change since it is now based on [`ioredis`](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) instead of [`node_redis`](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis).  Although this update is compatible with the most common uses of `apollo-server-cache-redis`, please check the [options supported by `ioredis`](https://github.com/luin/ioredis/blob/master/API.md#new-redisport-host-options) while updating to this version.  The constructor options are passed directly from `RedisCache` to the new Redis adapter.  The pre-1.0 versions should continue to work with Apollo Server without modification. [PR #1770](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1770)

## v2.5.1

- Upgrade GraphQL Playground to the latest upstream release.  This release also includes a new "Query Plan" panel for displaying the query planning results when running the Apollo Gateway.

## v2.5.0

### New

- New plugin package `apollo-server-plugin-response-cache` implementing a full query response cache based on `apollo-cache-control` hints. The implementation added a few hooks and context fields; see the PR for details. There is a slight change to `cacheControl` object: previously, `cacheControl.stripFormattedExtensions` defaulted to false if you did not provide a `cacheControl` option object, but defaulted to true if you provided (eg) `cacheControl: {defaultMaxAge: 10}`. Now `stripFormattedExtensions` defaults to false unless explicitly provided as `true`, or if you use the legacy boolean `cacheControl: true`. For more information, [read the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/caching).  [PR #2437](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2437)
- Add `rewriteError` option to `EngineReportingOptions` (i.e. the `engine` property of the `ApolloServer` constructor).  When defined as a `function`, it will receive an `err` property as its first argument which can be used to manipulate (e.g. redaction) an error prior to sending it to Apollo Engine by modifying, e.g., its `message` property.  The error can also be suppressed from reporting entirely by returning an explicit `null` value.  For more information, [read the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/errors#for-apollo-engine-reporting) and the [`EngineReportingOptions` API reference](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server#enginereportingoptions). `maskErrorDetails` is now deprecated. [PR #1639](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1639)
- `apollo-server-azure-functions`: Support `@azure/functions` to enable Apollo Server [Typescript development in Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/improving-the-typescript-support-in-azure-functions/). [PR #2487](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2487)
- Allow `GraphQLRequestListener` callbacks in plugins to depend on `this`. [PR #2470](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2470)
- `apollo-server-testing`: Add `variables` and `operationName` to `Query` and `Mutation` types. [PR #2307](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2307) [Issue #2172](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issue/2172)

### Bug fixes

- Add `cache-control: no-cache` header to both `PersistedQueryNotSupportedError` and `PersistedQueryNotFoundError` responses as these should never be cached. [PR #2452](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2452)
- `apollo-datasource-rest`: Don't attempt to parse "204 No Content" responses as JSON. [PR #2446](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2446)
- `apollo-server-express`: Fix Playground URL when Apollo Server is mounted inside of another Express app by utilizing `req.originalUrl`. [PR #2451](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2451)
- `apollo-datasource-rest`: Correctly allow a TTL value of `0` to represent "not-cacheable". [PR #2588](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2588)
- `apollo-datasource-rest`: Fix `Invalid argument` in IE11, when `this.headers` is `undefined`. [PR #2607](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2607)

## v2.4.8

- No functional changes in this version.  The patch version has been bumped to fix the `README.md` displayed on the [npm package for `apollo-server`](https://npm.im/apollo-server) as a result of a broken publish.  Apologies for the additional noise!

## v2.4.7

- Fix typings which incorrectly included `cors` as part of the constructor options for `apollo-server-express` (it should be defined via `applyMiddleware`) but, conversely, inadvertently omitted the perfectly valid `cors` option from the `apollo-server` constructor (where `applyMiddleware` is not used/available). [PR #2373](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2373) [Issue #1882](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/1882)

## v2.4.6

- Allow Node.js-like runtimes to identify as Node.js as well. [PR #2357](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2357) [Issue #2356](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issue/2356)

- `apollo-server-koa`: Support OPTIONS requests [PR #2288](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2288)
- Add `req` and `res` typings to the `ContextFunction` argument for apollo-server and apollo-server-express. Update `ContextFunction` return type to allow returning a value syncronously. [PR #2330](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2330)
- Type the `formatError` function to accept an GraphQLError as an argument and return a GraphQLFormattedError [PR #2343](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2343)

## v2.4.2

- `apollo-server-fastify` is now on Apollo Server and lives within the `apollo-server` repository.  This is being introduced in a _patch_ version, however it's a _major_ version bump from the last time `apollo-server-fastify` was published under `1.0.2`.  [PR #1971](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-server/pull/1971)
- Move `apollo-graphql` package to the `apollo-tooling` repository [PR #2316](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2316)

- Fix: Serialize arrays as JSON on fetch in `RESTDataSource`. [PR #2219](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2219)
- Fix: The `privateHeaders` configuration for `apollo-engine-reporting` now allows headers to be specified using any case and lower-cases them prior to comparison. [PR #2276](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2276)
- Fix broken `apollo-server-azure-functions` TypeScript definitions. [PR #2287](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2287)

## v2.3.1

- Provide types for `graphql-upload` in a location where they can be accessed by TypeScript consumers of `apollo-server` packages. [ccf935f9](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/ccf935f9) [Issue #2092](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/2092)

## v2.3.0

- **BREAKING FOR NODE.JS <= 8.5.0 ONLY**: To continue using Apollo Server 2.x in versions of Node.js prior to v8.5.0, file uploads must be disabled by setting `uploads: false` on the `ApolloServer` constructor options.  Without explicitly disabling file-uploads, the server will `throw` at launch (with instructions and a link to our documentation).

  This early deprecation is due to changes in the third-party `graphql-upload` package which Apollo Server utilizes to implement out-of-the-box file upload functionality.  While, in general, Apollo Server 2.x aims to support all Node.js versions which were under an LTS policy at the time of its release, we felt this required an exception.  By `throw`-ing when `uploads` is not explicitly set to `false`, we aim to make it clear immediately (rather than surprisingly) that this deprecation has taken effect.

  While Node.js 6.x is covered by a [Long Term Support agreement by the Node.js Foundation](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) until April 2019, there are substantial performance (e.g. [V8](https://v8.dev/) improvements) and language changes (e.g. "modern" ECMAScript support) offered by newer Node.js engines (e.g. 8.x, 10.x).  We encourage _all users_ of Apollo Server to update to newer LTS versions of Node.js prior to the "end-of-life" dates for their current server version.

  **We intend to drop support for Node.js 6.x in the next major version of Apollo Server.**

  For more information, see [PR #2054](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2054) and [our documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/migration-file-uploads.html).

## v2.2.7

- `apollo-engine-reporting`: When multiple instances of `apollo-engine-reporting` are loaded (an uncommon edge case), ensure that `encodedTraces` are handled only once rather than once per loaded instance. [PR #2040](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2040)

## v2.2.6

- `apollo-server-micro`: Set the `Content-type` to `text/html` for GraphQL Playground. [PR #2026](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2026)

## v2.2.5

- Follow-up on the update to `graphql-playground-html` in previous release by also bumping the minor version of the `graphql-playground-react` dependency to `1.7.10` — which is the version requested from the from the CDN bundle by `graphql-playground-html`. [PR #2037](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2037)

## v2.2.4

- Fix GraphQL Playground documentation scrolling bug in Safari by updating to latest (rebased) fork of `graphql-playground-html`. [PR #2037](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/2037)

## v2.2.3

- When `generateClientInfo` is not used to define the client name, client version and
client reference ID, Apollo Server will now default to the values present in the HTTP headers
of the request (`apollographql-client-name`, `apollographql-client-reference-id` and
`apollographql-client-version` respectively).  As a last resort, when those headers are not set,
the query extensions' `clientInfo` values will be used. [PR #1960](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1960)

## v2.2.2

- Fixed TypeScript 2.2 compatibility via updated `apollo-tooling` dependency. [Issue #1951](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/1951) [`26d6c739`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/26d6c739505b3112694e641c272c748ce38ba86b)
- Throw a more specific error when asynchronous introspection query behavior is detected. [PR #1955](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1955)

## v2.2.1

- Added support for an array of `modules` on the `ApolloServer` constructor options.  Each element of the `modules` can point to a module which exports `typeDefs` and `resolvers`.  These modules can be used in lieu of, or in combination with, directly specifying `schema` or `typeDefs`/`resolvers` on the constructor options.  This provides greater modularity and improved organization for logic which might be limited to a specific service. [`8f6481e6`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/8f6481e60f8418738f9ebbe9d5ab5e7e2ce4d319).
- Added `resolveObject` support to query execution.  [`bb67584`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/bb67584a224843a5b2509c2ebdd94e616fe6227c).
- Fix broken `apollo-server-cloud-functions` in 2.2.0 caused by missing TypeScript project references which resulted in the package not being published to npm in compiled form. [PR #1948](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1948)

## v2.2.0

- New request pipeline, including support for plugins which can implement lifecycle hooks at various stages of a request. [PR #1795](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1795).
- Introduce new `apollo-server-testing` utilities. [PR #1909](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1909)

- Allow an optional function to resolve the `rootValue`, passing the `DocumentNode` AST to determine the value. [PR #1555](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1555)
- Follow-up on the work in [PR #1516](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1516) to also fix missing insertion cursor/caret when a custom GraphQL configuration is specified which doesn't specify its own `cursorShape` property. [PR #1607](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1607)
- Azure functions support [Issue #1752](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issue/1752) [PR #1753](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1753) [PR #1948](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1948)
- Allow JSON parsing in `RESTDataSource` of Content Type `application/hal+json`. [PR #185](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1853)
- Add support for a `requestAgent` configuration parameter within the `engine` configuration.  This can be utilized when a proxy is necessary to transmit tracing and metrics data to Apollo Engine.  It accepts either an [`http.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) or [`https.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/https.html#https_class_https_agent) and behaves the same as the `agent` parameter to Node.js' [`http.request`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback). [PR #1879](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1879)
- Allow an optional parameter to the `RESTDataSource` constructor which takes a `node-fetch`-compatible `fetch` implementation that will be used for HTTP calls instead of the default fetch. [PR #1807](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/1807)
