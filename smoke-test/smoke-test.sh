# Ensure that we at least type-check against a variety of versions of Apollo
# Gateway. Specifically:
# - 0.50.1 is the oldest version that we try to support according to the
#   migration guide
# - 0.51.0 was the last version of 0.x before we converted it to use
#   `@apollo/server-gateway-interface` instead of directly depending on Apollo
#   Server packages
# - 0.x lets us test against the latest released 0.x version. (Theoretically it
#   would be better to pin a specific version and let Renovate update it so that
#   the Renovate PRs fail instead of `main` but this is simpler for now.)
# - 2.0.0 is the oldest supported version of v2.
# - 2.0.5 was the last version of 2.x before we converted it to use
#   `@apollo/server-gateway-interface` instead of directly depending on Apollo
#   Server packages
# - 2.x lets us test against the latest released 2.x version. (Theoretically it
#   would be better to pin a specific version and let Renovate update it so that
#   the Renovate PRs fail instead of `main` but this is simpler for now.)

# `--no-engine-strict` is required for some of the older ones on Node 18,
# because we used to really like putting `<` engine constraints on all our
# packages.
#
# This runs into some weird issues when we install the graphql@17 canary that
# seems to just be about ending up with two copies of `graphql` installed at
# different levels. For simplicity, we skip this part of the test in the canary
# job. Once graphql@17.0.0 is out we should be able to de-conditional this.
