   * as optional details like variable values and HTTP headers), or as part of
   * aggregated "stats" (where invocations of the same operation from the same
   * client program are aggregated together rather than described individually).
   * Apollo Server uses an heuristic to decide which operations to describe as
   * traces and which to aggregate as stats.
   *
   * By setting the `sendTraces` option to `false`, Apollo Server will describe
   * *all* operations as stats; individual requests will never be broken out
   * into separate traces. If you set `sendTraces: false`, then Apollo Studio's
   * Traces view won't show any traces (other Studio functionality will be

   *  `sendUnexecutableOperationDocuments` are irrelevant if you set
   *  `sendTraces: false`, because those options control data that is contained
   *  only in traces (not in stats).
   *
   * Setting `sendTraces: false` does *NOT* imply `fieldLevelInstrumentation:
   * 0`. Apollo Server can still take advantage of field-level instrumentation
   * (either directly for monolith servers, or via federated tracing for
   * Gateways) in order to accurately report field execution usage in "stats".
   * This option only controls whether data is sent to Apollo's servers as

  /**
   * This option allows you to choose if Apollo Server should calculate detailed
   * per-field statistics for a particular request. It is only called for
   * executable operations: operations which parse and validate properly and
   * which do not have an unknown operation name. It is not called if an
   * `includeRequest` hook is provided and returns false.
   *
   * You can either pass an async function or a number. The function receives a
   * `GraphQLRequestContext`. (The effect of passing a number is described
   * later.) Your function can return a boolean or a number; returning false is
   * equivalent to returning 0 and returning true is equivalent to returning 1.
   *
   * Returning false (or 0) means that Apollo Server will only pay attention to
   * overall properties of the operation, like what GraphQL operation is
   * executing and how long the entire operation takes to execute, and not
   * anything about field-by-field execution.
   *
   * If you return false (or 0), this operation *will* still contribute to most
   * features of Studio, such as schema checks, the Operations page, and the
   * "referencing operations" statistic on the Fields page, etc.
   *
   * If you return false (or 0), this operation will *not* contribute to the
   * "field executions" statistic on the Fields page or to the execution timing
   * hints optionally displayed in Studio Explorer or in vscode-graphql.
   * Additionally, this operation will not produce a trace that can be viewed on
   * the Traces section of the Operations page.
   *
   * Returning false (or 0) for some or all operations can improve your server's
   * performance, as the overhead of calculating complete traces is not always
   * negligible. This is especially the case if this server is an Apollo
   * Gateway, as captured traces are transmitted from the subgraph to the
   * Gateway in-band inside the actual GraphQL response.
   *
   * Returning a positive number means that Apollo Server will track each field
   * execution and send Apollo Studio statistics on how many times each field
   * was executed and what the per-field performance was. Apollo Server sends
   * both a precise observed execution count and an estimated execution count.
   * The former is calculated by counting each field execution as 1, and the
   * latter is calculated by counting each field execution as the number
   * returned from this hook, which can be thought of as a weight.
   *
   * Passing a number `x` (which should be between 0 and 1 inclusive) for
   * `fieldLevelInstrumentation` is equivalent to passing the function `async ()
   * => Math.random() < x ? 1/x : 0`.  For example, if you pass 0.01, then 99%
   * of the time this function will return 0, and 1% of the time this function
   * will return 100. So 99% of the time Apollo Server will not track field
   * executions, and 1% of the time Apollo Server will track field executions
   * and send them to Apollo Studio both as an exact observed count and as an
   * "estimated" count which is 100 times higher.  Generally, the weights you
   * return should be roughly the reciprocal of the probability that the
   * function returns non-zero; however, you're welcome to craft a more
   * sophisticated function, such as one that uses a higher probability for
   * rarer operations and a lower probability for more common operations.
   *
   * (Note that returning true here does *not* mean that the data derived from
   * field-level instrumentation must be transmitted to Apollo Studio's servers
   * in the form of a trace; it may still be aggregated locally to statistics.
   * Similarly, setting `sendTraces: false` does not affect
   * `fieldLevelInstrumentation`. But either way this operation will contribute
   * to the "field executions" statistic and timing hints.)
   *
   * The default `fieldLevelInstrumentation` is a function that always returns
   * true.
