// Apollo Gateway's API included `GraphQLRequestContext` from AS2/AS3.
// Specifically, a request context is passed to the main executor method, which
// it then exposes to user-configurable `GraphQLDataSource`s.
// `GraphQLRequestContext` has changed in incompatible ways in AS4; for example,
// we represent HTTP messages using our own data structures rather than Fetches,
// and some fields have been removed because they relate to features that don't
// exist any more.
//
// In general, the future of Apollo's development is in Apollo Router, not
// Gateway. So rather than have a big transition where a new version of Gateway
// supports AS4's GraphQLRequestContext instead of AS3's, we simply teach AS4
// how to produce AS3-style GraphQLRequestContext objects specifically for use
// by Gateway. We have changed Gateway to get its TS type definitions from a new
// package rather than from AS3 itself, so that Gateway no longer needs to
// depend on Apollo Server.
//
// This function turn an AS4 GraphQLRequestContext into a
// GatewayGraphQLRequestContext (which is basically an AS3
// GraphQLRequestContext).
//
// You might think that *after* invoking the executor, we would then need to
// propagate any changes made by the gateway back onto the "real"
// GraphQLRequestContext. It turns out that for each bit of data on the request
// context, this is either unnecessary or impossible. (We don't need to support
// use cases where people break type safe, eg by changing the values of readonly
// fields.) Here's why:
//
// Many fields on GatewayGraphQLRequestContext are declared readonly and their
// values are taken directly from the real GraphQLRequestContext. This means
// that gateways should not change the field's value, and any mutations of the
// object stored in the field (say, calling
// `requestContext.overallCachePolicy.restrict`, as RemoteGraphQLDataSource
// does) already take effect.
//
//  The only two fields not declared as readonly are `logger` and `debug`.
//
// Technically, a gateway implementation could set `requestContext.logger` to a
// different Logger without breaking the TypeScript declarations. In AS4 we
// don't actually have a requestContext.logger; we have `readonly
// requestContext.server` and `readonly server.logger`. So there's not an easy
// way for us to carry out this change: AS4 just doesn't let gateway or plugins
// override the server's logger (and generally doesn't allow the logger to
// change after the server is created), which seems like a simpler model. If it
// turns out there is a real use case for the gateway to be able to change the
// overall logger for the request as seen by plugins, we can fix that later.
//
// Similarly, it's not clear what the intended use case of mutating `debug` in
// gateway would be. `debug` has now mostly changed into
// `includeStacktraceInErrorResponses`. So perhaps this could be used to let you
// decide whether or not to include the stacktrace on a per-operation basis...
// but you can also use `formatError` or `didEncounterErrors` for this perhaps?
// In any case, AS4 doesn't track `includeStacktraceInErrorResponses` on a
// per-operation basis; if we find a use case for this we can add it later.
//
// So we'll just ignore changes to `logger` and `debug`.
//
// Next, there's `request`. We don't know of a use case for mutating the
// *request* at execution time. If there was a real use case, we could add a
// function that copies pieces back from the gateway `request` to the AS4
// request, but we're not bothering to yet.
//
// Finally, there's `response`. Sure, the executor *could* mutate `response`.
// But the main thing the executor is doing is *returning* a response, which
// then semi-overwrites `requestContext.response` anyway. So it doesn't seem
// like we need to support `executor` *also* overwriting response. Yet again, we
// can fix this if it turns out it's necessary. (That said, the executor could
// in theory write HTTP response headers or status, so we make sure to hook them
// up directly to the appropriate data in the real GraphQLRequestContext.)
//
// So all in all, it looks like it's OK for this to be a "one-way" conversion.
