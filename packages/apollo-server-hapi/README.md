[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/apollo-server-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/apollo-server-core) [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-cache-control-js.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-cache-control-js) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/apollographql/apollo-server/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/apollographql/apollo-server?branch=master) [![Get on Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join-orange.svg)](https://www.apollographql.com/#slack)

This is the Hapi integration of Apollo Server. Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source Apollo Server that works with all Node.js HTTP server frameworks: Express, Connect, Hapi, Koa and Restify. [Read the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). [Read the CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

```sh
npm install apollo-server-hapi
```

## Usage

After constructing Apollo server, a hapi server can be enabled with a call to `registerServer`. Ensure that `autoListen` is set to false in the `Hapi.server` constructor.

The code below requires Hapi 17 or higher.

```js
const Hapi = require('hapi');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { registerServer } = require('apollo-server-hapi');

const HOST = 'localhost';

async function StartServer() {
  const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

  //Note: autoListen is required, since Apollo Server will start the listener
  const app = new Hapi.server({
    autoListen: false,
    host: HOST,
  });

  //apply other plugins

  await registerServer({ server, app });

  //port is optional and defaults to 4000
  server.listen({ port: 4000 }).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
  });
}

StartServer().catch(error => console.log(e));
```
