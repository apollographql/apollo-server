  // to return true) do not support calling `start()`, because their lifecycle
  // doesn't allow you to wait before assigning a handler or allowing the
  // handler to be called. So they call `ensureStarting` at the end of the

  /**
   * @deprecated This deprecated method is provided for backwards compatibility

   * `ensureStarting` and `start`; it was generally called "in the background"
   * by integrations to kick off the start process (like `ensureStarting`) and
   * then the Promise it returns was awaited later before running operations
   * (sort of like `start`).  It had odd error handling semantics, in that it
   * would ignore any error that came from loading the schema, but would throw
   * errors that came from `serverWillStart`.
   *
   * We keep it around for backwards-compatibility with pre-v2.22 integrations,
   * though we just make it call `ensureStarting`. This does mean that the part
   * of the integration which awaits its result doesn't actually await anything
   * interesting (despite being async, the method itself doesn't await
   * anything), but since executing operations now calls `ensureStarted`, that's
   * OK. (In v2.22.0 and v2.22.1 we tried to mimic the old `willStart` behavior
   * more closely which led to a bug where `start` could be invoked multiple
   * times. This approach is simpler.)
   *
   * Anyone calling this method should call `start` or `ensureStarting` instead.
