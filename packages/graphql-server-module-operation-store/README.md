The `graphql-server-module-operation-store` package is now called [`apollo-server-module-operation-store`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-module-operation-store). We are continuing to release matching versions of the package under the old name, but we recommend you switch to using the new name. The API is identical.
