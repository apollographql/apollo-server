[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/apollo-server-koa.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/apollo-server-koa) [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-server.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-server) [![Join the community on Spectrum](https://withspectrum.github.io/badge/badge.svg)](https://spectrum.chat/apollo)


This is the Koa integration of GraphQL Server. Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server that works with many Node.js HTTP server frameworks. [Read the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). [Read the CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

```shell
npm install apollo-server-koa graphql
```

## Koa

```js
const Koa = require('koa');
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-koa');

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Provide resolver functions for your schema fields
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

const app = new Koa();
server.applyMiddleware({ app });
// alternatively you can get a composed middleware from the apollo server
// app.use(server.getMiddleware());

app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`),
);
```

## Principles

GraphQL Server is built with the following principles in mind:

- **By the community, for the community**: GraphQL Server's development is driven by the needs of developers
- **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure
- **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed
