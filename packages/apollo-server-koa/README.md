This is the Koa integration of GraphQL Server. Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server that works with many Node.js HTTP server frameworks. [Read the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). [Read the CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

```shell
npm install apollo-server-koa graphql
```

## Koa

```js
const Koa = require('koa');
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-koa');

async function startApolloServer() {
  // Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
  const typeDefs = gql`
    type Query {
      hello: String
    }
  `;

  // Provide resolver functions for your schema fields
  const resolvers = {
    Query: {
      hello: () => 'Hello world!',
    },
  };

  const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
  await server.start();

  const app = new Koa();
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });
  // alternatively you can get a composed middleware from the apollo server
  // app.use(server.getMiddleware());

  await new Promise(resolve => app.listen({ port: 4000 }, resolve));
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`);
  return { server, app };
}
```

## Principles

GraphQL Server is built with the following principles in mind:

- **By the community, for the community**: GraphQL Server's development is driven by the needs of developers
- **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure
- **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed
