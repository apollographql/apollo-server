### vNEXT

> The changes noted within this `vNEXT` section have not been released yet.  New PRs and commits which introduce changes should include an entry in this `vNEXT` section as part of their development.  When a release is being prepared, a new header will be (manually) created below and the the appropriate changes within that release will be moved into the new section.

- Add inadvertently excluded `apollo-server-errors` runtime dependency. [#3927](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3927)

## 0.14.1

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/b898396e9fcd3b9092b168f9aac8466ca186fa6b)

- __FIX__: Resolve condition which surfaced in `0.14.0` which prevented loading the configuration using managed federation. [PR #3979](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3979)

## 0.14.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/71a3863f59f4ab2c9052c316479d94c6708c4309)

- Several previously unhandled Promise rejection errors stemming from, e.g. connectivity, failures when communicating with Apollo Graph Manager within asynchronous code are now handled. [PR #3811](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3811)
- Provide a more helpful error message when encountering expected errors. [PR #3811](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3811)
- General improvements and clarity to error messages and logging. [PR #3811](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3811)
- Warn of a possible misconfiguration when local service configuration is provided (via `serviceList` or `localServiceList`) and a remote Apollo Graph Manager configuration is subsequently found as well. [PR #3868](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3868)
- During composition, the unavailability of a downstream service in unmanaged federation mode will no longer result in a partially composed schema which merely lacks the types provided by the downed service.  This prevents unexpected validation errors for clients querying a graph which lacks types which were merely unavailable during the initial composition but were intended to be part of the graph. [PR #3867](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3867)
- Support providing a custom logger implementation (e.g. [`winston`](https://npm.im/winston), [`bunyan`](https://npm.im/bunyan), etc.) to capture gateway-sourced console output.  This allows the use of existing, production logging facilities or the possibiltiy to use advanced structure in logging, such as console output which is encapsulated in JSON.  The same PR that introduces this support also introduces a `logger` property to the `GraphQLRequestContext` that is exposed to `GraphQLDataSource`s and Apollo Server plugins, making it possible to attach additional properties (as supported by the logger implementation) to specific requests, if desired, by leveraging custom implementations in those components respectively.  When not provided, these will still output to `console`. [PR #3894](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3894)
- Drop use of `loglevel-debug`.  This removes the very long date and time prefix in front of each log line and also the support for the `DEBUG=apollo-gateway:` environment variable.  Both of these were uncommonly necessary or seldom used (with the environment variable also being undocumented).  The existing behavior can be preserved by providing a `logger` that uses `loglevel-debug`, if desired, and more details can be found in the PR.  [PR #3896](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3896)
- Fix Typescript generic typing for datasource contexts [#3865](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3865) This is a fix for the `TContext` typings of the gateway's exposed `GraphQLDataSource` implementations. In their current form, they don't work as intended, or in any manner that's useful for typing the `context` property throughout the class methods. This introduces a type argument `TContext` to the class itself (which defaults to `Record<string, any>` for existing implementations) and removes the non-operational type arguments on the class methods themselves.
- Implement retry logic for requests to GCS [PR #3836](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3836) Note: coupled with this change is a small alteration in how the gateway polls GCS for updates in managed mode. Previously, the tick was on a specific interval. Now, every tick starts after the round of fetches to GCS completes. For more details, see the linked PR.
- Gateway issues health checks to downstream services via `serviceHealthCheck` configuration option. Note: expected behavior differs between managed and unmanaged federation. See PR for new test cases and documentation. [#3930](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3930)

## 0.13.2

- __BREAKING__: The behavior and signature of `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`'s `didReceiveResponse` method has been changed.  No changes are necessary _unless_ your implementation has overridden the default behavior of this method by either extending the class and overriding the method or by providing `didReceiveResponse` as a parameter to the `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`'s constructor options.  Implementations which have provided their own `didReceiveResponse` using either of these methods should view the PR linked here for details on what has changed.  [PR #3743](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3743)
- __NEW__: Setting the `apq` option to `true` on the `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` will enable the use of [automated persisted queries (APQ)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/) when sending queries to downstream services.  Depending on the complexity of queries sent to downstream services, this technique can greatly reduce the size of the payloads being transmitted over the network.  Downstream implementing services must also support APQ functionality to participate in this feature (Apollo Server does by default unless it has been explicitly disabled).  As with normal APQ behavior, a downstream server must have received and registered a query once before it will be able to serve an APQ request. [#3744](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3744)
- __NEW__: Experimental feature: compress downstream requests via generated fragments [#3791](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3791) This feature enables the gateway to generate fragments for queries to downstream services in order to minimize bytes over the wire and parse time. This can be enabled via the gateway config by setting `experimental_autoFragmentization: true`. It is currently disabled by default.
- Introduce `make-fetch-happen` package. Remove `cachedFetcher` in favor of the caching implementation provided by this package. [#3783](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3783/files)

## v0.12.1

- Update to include [fixes from `@apollo/federation`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/packages/apollo-federation/CHANGELOG.md).

## v0.12.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/9c0aa1e661ccc2c5a1471b781102637dd47e21b1)

- Reduce interface expansion for types contained to a single service [#3582](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3582)
- Instantiate one `CachedFetcher` per gateway instance.  This resolves a condition where multiple federated gateways would utilize the same cache store could result in an `Expected undefined to be a GraphQLSchema` error. [#3704](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3704)
- Gateway: minimize downstream request size [#3737](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3737)
- experimental: Allow configuration of the query plan store by introducing an `experimental_approximateQueryPlanStoreMiB` property to the `ApolloGateway` constructor options which overrides the default cache size of 30MiB. [#3755](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3755)

## v0.11.6

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/0743d6b2f1737758cf09e80d2086917772bc00c9)

- Fix onSchemaChange callbacks for unmanaged configs [#3605](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3605)

## v0.11.4

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/a0a60e73e04e913d388de8324f7d17e4406deea2)

 * Gateway over-merging fields of unioned types [#3581](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3581)

## v0.11.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/93002737d53dd9a50b473ab9cef14849b3e539aa)

- Begin supporting executable directives in federation [#3464](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3464)

## v0.10.8

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/5d94e986f04457ec17114791ee6db3ece4213dd8)

- Fix Gateway / Playground Query Plan view [#3418](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3418)
- Gateway schema change listener bug + refactor [#3411](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3411) introduces a change to the `experimental_didUpdateComposition` hook and `experimental_pollInterval` configuration behavior.
  1. Previously, the `experimental_didUpdateComposition` hook wouldn't be reliably called unless the `experimental_pollInterval` was set. If it _was_ called, it was sporadic and didn't necessarily mark the timing of an actual composition update. After this change, the hook is called on a successful composition update.
  2. The `experimental_pollInterval` configuration option now affects both the GCS polling interval when gateway is configured for managed federation, as well as the polling interval of services. The former being newly introduced behavior.
- Gateway cached DataSource bug [#3412](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3412) introduces a fix for managed federation users where `DataSource`s wouldn't update correctly if a service's url changed. This bug was introduced with heavier DataSource caching in [#3388](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3388). By inspecting the `url` as well, `DataSource`s will now update correctly when a composition update occurs.
- Gateway - don't log updates on startup [#3421](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3421) Fine tune gateway startup logging - on load, instead of logging an "update", log the service id, variant, and mode in which gateway is running.
