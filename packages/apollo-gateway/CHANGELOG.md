- _Nothing yet! Stay tuned._

## v0.12.1

- Update to include [fixes from `@apollo/federation`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/packages/apollo-federation/CHANGELOG.md).

## v0.12.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/9c0aa1e661ccc2c5a1471b781102637dd47e21b1)

- Reduce interface expansion for types contained to a single service [#3582](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3582)
- Instantiate one `CachedFetcher` per gateway instance.  This resolves a condition where multiple federated gateways would utilize the same cache store could result in an `Expected undefined to be a GraphQLSchema` error. [#3704](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3704)
- Gateway: minimize downstream request size [#3737](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3737)
- experimental: Allow configuration of the query plan store by introducing an `experimental_approximateQueryPlanStoreMiB` property to the `ApolloGateway` constructor options which overrides the default cache size of 30MiB. [#3755](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3755)

## v0.11.6

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/0743d6b2f1737758cf09e80d2086917772bc00c9)

- Fix onSchemaChange callbacks for unmanaged configs [#3605](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3605)

## v0.11.4

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/a0a60e73e04e913d388de8324f7d17e4406deea2)

 * Gateway over-merging fields of unioned types [#3581](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3581)

## v0.11.0

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/93002737d53dd9a50b473ab9cef14849b3e539aa)

- Begin supporting executable directives in federation [#3464](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3464)

## v0.10.8

> [See complete versioning details.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/5d94e986f04457ec17114791ee6db3ece4213dd8)

- Fix Gateway / Playground Query Plan view [#3418](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3418)
- Gateway schema change listener bug + refactor [#3411](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3411) introduces a change to the `experimental_didUpdateComposition` hook and `experimental_pollInterval` configuration behavior.
  1. Previously, the `experimental_didUpdateComposition` hook wouldn't be reliably called unless the `experimental_pollInterval` was set. If it _was_ called, it was sporadic and didn't necessarily mark the timing of an actual composition update. After this change, the hook is called on a successful composition update.
  2. The `experimental_pollInterval` configuration option now affects both the GCS polling interval when gateway is configured for managed federation, as well as the polling interval of services. The former being newly introduced behavior.
- Gateway cached DataSource bug [#3412](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3412) introduces a fix for managed federation users where `DataSource`s wouldn't update correctly if a service's url changed. This bug was introduced with heavier DataSource caching in [#3388](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3388). By inspecting the `url` as well, `DataSource`s will now update correctly when a composition update occurs.
- Gateway - don't log updates on startup [#3421](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/3421) Fine tune gateway startup logging - on load, instead of logging an "update", log the service id, variant, and mode in which gateway is running.
