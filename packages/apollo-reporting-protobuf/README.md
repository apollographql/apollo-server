This module provides JavaScript/TypeScript
[Protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) definitions
for the Apollo usage reporting API.  These definitions are generated for
consumption from the `reports.proto` file which is defined internally within
Apollo.

## Development

> **Note:** Due to a dependency on Unix tools (e.g. `bash`, `grep`, etc.), the
> development of this module requires a Unix system.  There is no reason why
> this can't be avoided, the time just hasn't been taken to make those changes.
> We'd happily accept a PR which makes the appropriate changes!

Currently, this package generates a majority of its code with
`@apollo/protobufjs` (a fork of
[`protobufjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs) that we maintain
specifically for this package) based on the `reports.proto` file. The output is
generated with the `generate` npm script.

The root of the repository provides some `devDependencies` necessary to build
these definitionsÂ qand the `prepare` npm script is invoked programmatically via
the monorepo tooling (e.g. Lerna) thanks to _this_ module's `postinstall`
script.  Therefore, when making changes to this module, run scripts via `npx
lerna run SCRIPTNAME` in the **root** of this monorepo in order to update the
definitions in _this_ module.

To update `reports.proto` to the current version recognized by the Studio usage
reporting ingress, run `lerna run update-proto`. To then regenerate the JS and
TS files, run `npx lerna run generate`. We check in the generated code and only
regenerate it manually, partially to make builds faster (no need to run pbjs on
every `npm install`) and partially so that we don't have to make sure that
`pbjs` runs on every Node version that we support.
