# As far as we can tell, `npm deprecate` only deprecates currently existing
# package versions. Whenever we publish a backport to AS2/AS3, the latest
# version will end up not deprecated! So after publishing backport versions, we
# run this script (with apollo-bot credentials). As far as we can tell you can't
# use npm tokens for this so it requires you to enter a ton of OTPs. Fun!
